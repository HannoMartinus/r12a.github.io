          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Fri 4 Jan 2008 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=apps">apps</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=pickers"> pickers </a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I‚Äôve been wanting to improve the editing behaviour of <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/">my pickers</a> for quite some time, so that users could interact more easily with the 
            keyboard, and insert characters into the middle of a composition, not 
            just at the end. In fact, the output area maintains the focus all the 
            time, now ‚Äì which makes a major improvement to the usability of the 
            pickers.</p>
          <p>This week I made those things happen, and created a new template with some other changes, too.</p>
          <p>An updated Bengali picker is first out of the box, but look out for a
            brand new Urdu-specific picker to follow close on its heels.  I will 
            retrofit the new template to other pickers as time allows, or need 
            dictates.</p>
          <p>I also beefed up the font selection list with a large number of TT 
            and OT fonts, and improved the reference material at the bottom.</p>
          <p>I improved the mechanism that highlights similar characters, to give 
            more fine-grained control to the associations between characters.</p>
          <p>I also added a field just under the title that gives information 
            about the character the user is mousing over, and added a search field 
            to help users find characters for which they know the Unicode name or 
            number.  I plan to extend the information associated with characters in 
            future to include native names (eg. e-kar) and other useful search info.</p>
          <p>I also changed the scripting and HTML so that a single click can now 
            produce multiple characters in the composition field.  This will allow 
            users to input ligatures like the indic ‚Äòksha‚Äô or Urdu aspirated 
            consonants, or complex sequences tied to ligatures (like the word 
            ‚ÄòAllah‚Äô) with a simple click.</p>
          <p>Some things have also been removed.  There is no DEL button now, 
            since you can interact more easily with the keyboard for that.  Spaces 
            are available from the (now rationalised) character area, rather than a 
            button. And there is no longer an option to switch between graphics and 
            characters for the selection.  This is partly for simplicity, and partly
            to make it easier to represent some of the slightly more complicated 
            selection options I want to add in future ‚Äì for example, specific shapes
            are appropriate for Urdu arabic characters, and I don‚Äôt want to leave 
            it to chance as to whether the user‚Äôs system has the right fonts to 
            produce the desired shapes.</p>
          <p>Getting to this actually required a huge amount of unseen work, since
            I had to wrap all the images in button markup and move and change 
            attributes, etc. so that the composition box retains the focus in IE (it
            worked fine for Firefox, Opera and Safari).  I also, of course, made 
            significant, but probably not noticeable, changes to the Javascript and 
            CSS.</p>

          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Thu 20 Dec 2007 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I just read a <a href="http://ivanherman.wordpress.com/2007/12/20/schengen-non%e2%80%93borders/">post by Ivan Herman</a> about how Hungary has joined the Schengen Agreement, and will soon be 
            removing border controls on the EU side.  That put me in mind of the 
            first time I tried to pass through the Iron Curtain.</p>
          <p>I was travelling from Vienna to Budapest (probably about 25 years ago) and I had decided to go through <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=sopron">Sopron</a>,
            rather than Hegyeshalom, so I could see something a little more off the
            beaten track. This was a month-long InterRail trip, so I was able to 
            follow my whim and jump on whatever train I wanted. The train 
            connections worked, and I found myself heading south from Vienna.</p>
          <p>Eventually, the train passed into Hungary and stopped. I needed a 
            visa, so I got off with a bunch of other (Hungarian looking) people, and
            traipsed over to a small outbuilding, where I found myself at the back 
            of a queue of people jostling bags of various sizes and dressed and 
            coiffed in what looked to me to be a very Eastern European fashion.  
            Looking out of the window, everything was grey. I could see rail tracks 
            and points and small, grey buildings but also several very tall towers 
            with machine gun nests perched on top (quite large looking machine 
            guns). The queue moved slowly, and I was surprised at one point to see 
            my train pulling away and disappearing.  It seemed a bit odd (and I was 
            glad I‚Äôd brought all my stuff with me), but I figured this was probably 
            normal, and I‚Äôd just have to catch another train.</p>
          <p>I finally arrived at the desk and asked for a visa. The guy behind 
            the desk started talking to me in a somewhat animated fashion, but I had
            no idea what he was saying. I hadn‚Äôt learned German yet, and Hungarian 
            was completely incomprehensible to me.  I kept trying to explain, 
            politely, in English, that I needed a visa.  Finally, he gave me an 
            exasperated look and called someone out of a nearby room.  The guy who 
            emerged was huge, bald and intimidatingly business-like. (Some time 
            later I saw the film Midnight Express, and realised that the prison 
            guard and he could have been the same person.) He shouted at me ‚ÄúNicht 
            visa!‚Äù.  And I tried to explain, in English, that, yes, I had no visa, 
            but would like to obtain one, please. This didn‚Äôt appear to get across 
            clearly, because he simply repeated ‚ÄúNicht visa!!‚Äù several times, 
            increasing in volume.</p>
          <p>Finally, the tension broke and gave way to action.  He motioned for 
            me to follow him out of the building, and we started walking away across
            a couple of sets of railway tracks.  I noticed, feeling slightly less 
            at ease but still hopeful, that I was flanked by a soldier with a gun on
            either side. They weren‚Äôt exactly giving me encouraging looks, and as I
            glanced up at the machine gun towers and at the surrounding barbed 
            wire, I began to wish I knew what was happening.</p>
          <p>Soon we arrived at the end of a short train. The very last carriage 
            of this train looked like something you‚Äôd expect to see in a Wild West 
            film.  It had a kind of standing area at each end with a railing, a door
            into the carriage and steps leading down to the ground on either side. 
            I was ushered up one set of steps and into what turned out to be an 
            empty carriage. The door was shut behind me, and within a minute or so, 
            as I remember it, the train started moving off, in the same direction my
            earlier train had disappeared. So I wasn‚Äôt just being sent back across 
            the border. </p>
          <p>That last realisation started to trouble me a little, since I still 
            had no visa and no idea what was happening.  It didn‚Äôt help that there 
            was a small round window in the door at each end of the carriage, 
            through which I could see  guards sitting on the steps at each corner, 
            all holding machine guns at the ready.  As the towers slid away behind 
            us, night started to fall.</p>
          <p>Twenty five years has dulled the memory of some of what happened 
            next, but eventually I got off at a small station, having reached the 
            end of the line. The guards were gone, and the station turned out to be 
            quite modern and clean looking. I still couldn‚Äôt understand anything 
            anyone was saying, so I still had no idea where I was, but I was able 
            figure out that I was somehow back in Austria.  It was much later that I
            was to realise that Sopron is on a peninsular that sticks into Austria,
            and I had come in one side and been sent out the other.</p>
          <p>I slept that night on the floor of the main station building, and the
            next morning set off to find someone who spoke English and could tell 
            me where I was ‚Äì and just as importantly how to get into Hungary.  The 
            town was quite small, maybe just a village.  In spite of that it took me
            a while, but I eventually came across a chap in a supermarket who was 
            able to explain to me that visas are not issued on entry into Hungary by
            train via Sopron.  I was ahead of him there.  He also offered to drive 
            me to the border, telling me that I would be able to get a visa at the 
            road entry point.</p>
          <p>It‚Äôs nice to think about that person whenever I relive this story.  
            He really went out of his way, leaving work to assist a complete 
            stranger, with no fuss or thought for reward.  I wonder whether he 
            remembers me.  I doubt it. Of course, these days he may even be reading 
            this blog post‚Ä¶</p>
          <p>So it was that, eventually, I got the stamp in my passport that I 
            needed, and somehow found my way onto another train heading for 
            Budapest.  Well, it wasn‚Äôt quite the end of the fun.  That continued 
            when I tried to meet up with my father in the capital.  But that, as 
            they say, is another story‚Ä¶</p>

          <p>Tim Greenwood just pointed out to me a ‚Äòbug‚Äô in my <a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-conversion?codepoints=00A0&amp;origin=codepoint">converter program</a>, which I think is actually, in my mind, a bug in Firefox (although I imagine it was implemented by someone as a feature).</p>
          <p>If you type A0 (the hex code for a non-breaking space) in the 
            Hexadecimal code points field, then press Convert, you will get a blank 
            space in the Characters field that should be U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE.  
            Then press Convert or View Names above this Characters field and you‚Äôll 
            find that what was supposed to be a NBSP has changed into an ordinary 
            space.  IE7, Opera and Safari all continue to show the character in the 
            field as a NBSP. </p>
          <p>(However, all four browsers substitute an ordinary space when you 
            copy and paste the text from the Characters field into something else.)</p>
          <p>I tried this with <a href="https://r12a.github.io/uniview/?codepoints=2002%202003%202006%202008%202009%20200B">a range of other types of space</a> , but had no such behaviour (<a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-conversion?codepoints=2002%202003%202006%202008%202009%20200B&amp;origin=codepoint">try it</a>).  They all remained themselves. </p>

            <span class="caption">The word Mandalay in Myanmar script.</span></p>
          <p>I‚Äôve been brushing up on the Myanmar script, since major changes are on the way with Unicode 5.1. </p>
          <p>I upgraded my <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/myanmar/">myanmar picker</a> to handle the new characters, and I edited <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/scriptnotes/myanmar/">my notes on how the script works</a>.</p>
          <p>The new characters will make a big difference to how you author text 
            in Unicode, and people will need to update currently existing pages to 
            bring them in line with the new approach.  The changes should make it <em>much</em> easier to create content in Burmese, in addition to addressing some 
            niggly problems with making the script work correctly.  One reason the 
            changes were sanctioned is that there is currently very little Burmese 
            content out there in Unicode.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôll be updating my <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/scriptnotes/myanmar/mymrchars">character by character notes</a> later too.</p>
          <p>The only problem with all this is that existing fonts will all need 
            to be changed to support the new world order (or myanmar order).  I 
            found one font that is already 5.1 ready from the <a href="http://www.myanmarnlp.net.mm/opentype.htm">Myanmar Unicode &amp; NLP Research Center</a>.  So if you don‚Äôt want to download that font, you‚Äôll need to read the <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/scriptnotes/myanmar/myanmar.pdf">PDF version</a> of my notes on the script. </p>
          <p>That would be a pity, however, since i had some fun adding javascript
            to the article today, so that it displays a breakdown, character by 
            character, of each example as you mouse over it (using images, so you 
            see it properly).</p>

          <p>This web-based tool helps you convert between a number of Unicode escape and code formats.</p>
          <p>Changes in the new version:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Convert from JavaScript, Java and C escape notation, and to 
              JavaScript/Java escapes (with switch to show C-style supplementary 
              characters)</li>
            <li>Convert to and from CSS escape notation</li>
            <li>Convert from HTML/XML code with escapes to code with just characters</li>
            <li>Convert &lt; &gt; ‚Äù or &amp; in HTML/XML code to entities</li>
            <li>Option to show ASCII characters when converting to NCRs</li>
            <li>View a set of characters in UniView by clicking on the View in UniView button</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="text-decoration:line-through;">For CSS output I chose the 
            6-figure version with no optional space, since I thought it was 
            clearest.  I‚Äôve had a request to change it to the shortest form (4 or 6 
            figures) followed by space.  If other people prefer that, I may change 
            it.</p>
          <p><strong>Update:</strong> Markus Scherer convinced me to change the 
            CSS output. So rather than 6-figure escapes with no space, the output 
            now contains 6-figure escapes followed by a space for supplementary 
            characters, and 4-figure escapes followed by a space elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Changes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Extended the ability to open UniView with data displayed from a URI.
              In addition to specifying a block and a character, you can now specify a
              range, a list of codepoints, a list of characters, or a search string. 
              This is useful for pointing people to results using URIs in links or 
              email.</li>
            <li>Switching between graphics or fonts for display of characters now refreshes the right panel also.</li>
            <li>Clicking on the information about the script group of a character 
              displayed in the right panel will cause that block to be displayed in 
              the left panel. This is particularly useful when you find a single 
              character and want to know what‚Äôs around it.</li>
            <li>Replaced the use of hyphens to specify block names in URI queries 
              with underscores or %20. This may break some existing URIs, but fixes a 
              bug that meant that block names that actually contain hyphens were not 
              displaying.</li>
            <li>Added an option to the right hand panel to display the current character in the Unicode Conversion tool.</li>
            <li>Fixed some other bugs related to specifying Basic Latin block in a URI.</li>
            <li>Reinstated CJK Unified Ideographics and Hangul Syllables in the 
              block selection pull-down, but added a warning and opt out if the block 
              you are about to display contains more than 2000 characters. Also added 
              warning and opt out if you try to specify a range of over 2000 
              characters.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please report any bugs to me, and don‚Äôt forget to refresh any UniView files in your cache before using the new version.</p>

          <p>In little pockets of time recently I‚Äôve been making some significant 
            improvements to my UniView tool, the character map on steroids.</p>
          <p>Changes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Substantially revised the code so that handling of ideographic and 
              hangul characters and other characters not in the Unidata database is 
              much improved. For example, ideographs now display in the left panel for
              a specified range and property values are available in the right panel.</li>
            <li>Added regular expression support to the search input field.</li>
            <li>Changes to the user interface: moved highlighting controls to the 
              initial screens and move others, such as the chart numbering toggle, to 
              the submenu under ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù; provided wider input fields for codepoint 
              and cut&amp;paste input; replaced the graphics and list toggle icons 
              with checkboxes; provided an icon to quickly clear the contents of the 
              codepoint and cut&amp;paste input fields. A link to the UniHan database 
              was added alongside the Cut &amp; paste input field: when clicked, this 
              icon looks up the first character in either field. A link to the UniHan 
              database was also added to the right panel when a Unified CJK character 
              is displayed there.</li>
            <li>The Codepoint input field now accepts more than one codepoint (separated by spaces).</li>
            <li>When you double-click on a character in the left panel the codepoint
              is appended to the Codepoint input field as well as adding the 
              character to the Cut &amp; paste field.</li>
            <li>When you click in the checkbox Show as graphics the change is 
              immediately applied to whatever is in the left panel. It no longer 
              redisplays the range if you are looking at, say, a list of characters 
              generated by the Codepoint input, but redisplays the same list.</li>
            <li>Set the default font to ‚ÄúArial Unicode MS, sans-serif‚Äù.</li>
            <li>Added a message for those who do not have JavaScript turned on, and 
              messages to please wait while data is being downloaded on initial 
              startup.</li>
            <li>Fixed the icons linking to the converter tool, so that the contents 
              of the adjacent field are passed to the converter and converted 
              automatically.</li>
            <li>Added links in the right panel to FileFormat pages (in addition to 
              decodeUnicode). The FileFormat pages provide useful information for Java
              and .Net users about a given character.</li>
            <li>Removed the option to specify your own character notes (I‚Äôm not 
              aware that anyone ever did, since it hasn‚Äôt worked for a while now and 
              no-one has complained). This is because AJAX technology will not allow 
              an XML file to be included from another domain. When that is fixed I 
              will reinstate it.</li>
            <li>Fixed a number of other bugs, particularly related to supplementary character support and highlighting.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please report any bugs to me, and don‚Äôt forget to refresh any UniView files in your cache before using the new version.</p>

          <p>This web-based tool helps you convert between Unicode character 
            numbers, characters, UTF-8 and UTF-16 code units in hex, percent 
            escapes, Unicode U+hex notation, and Numeric Character References (hex 
            and decimal).</p>
          <p>Changes in the new version:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Convert to and from Unicode U+hex notation</li>
            <li>Get a list of Unicode names for a sequence of characters by clicking on the View Names button</li>
            <li>You now have to click a button to start the conversion, rather than 
              remove focus from the input area. This provides better control and a 
              more intuitive approach.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It also allows you to separate a sequence of characters by spaces. Paste the characters into the <code>Characters</code> field and click <code>Convert</code>. Then click <code>Convert</code> immediately in the <code>Unicode U+hex notation</code> field. (The latter field is the only one that changes the data after an initial conversion.)</p>

          <p>I received a query from someone asking:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>I try to edit lao and thai text with XMetal 5.0, but 
              nothing is displayed but squares. In fact, Unicode characters seems to 
              be correctly saved in the XML file and displayed in Firefox (for 
              example), but i can‚Äôt get a correct display in XMetal. Is it a font 
              problem ?</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>There are two places this needs to be addressed:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>in the plain text view</li>
            <li>in the tags-on view</li>
          </ol>
          <p>For the plain text view, it is a question of setting a font that 
            shows Lao and Thai (or whatever other language/script you need) in 
            Tools&gt;Options&gt;Plain Text View&gt;Font.  You can only set one font 
            at a time, so a wide ranging Unicode font like Arial Unicode MS or 
            Code2000 may be useful for Windows users.</p>
          <p>For the tags-on view (which is the view I use most of the time) you 
            need to edit the CSS file that sets the editor‚Äôs styling for the DOCTYPE
            you are working with.  This may be in one of a number of places.  The 
            one I edit is C:\Program Files\Blast Radius\XMetaL 
            4.6\Author\Display\xhtml1-transitional.css.</p>
          <p>I added the following to mine.  I chose fonts I have on my PC and 
            sets font sizes relative to the size I set for my body element.  You 
            should, of course, choose your own fonts and sizes.</p>

          <p>Note that I would have preferred to say :lang(am) { font-family‚Ä¶ }

          <h2 class="post-title">Complex scripts in Mozilla</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Tue 21 Aug 2007 tagged as  <a href="/blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I see from a recent <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75011">bugzilla report</a> and some cursory testing that a (very) long-standing bug in Mozilla related to complex scripts has now been fixed.</p>
          <p>Complex scripts include many non-Latin scripts that use combining 
            characters or ligatures, or that apply shaping to adjacent characters 
            like Arabic script.</p>
          <p>It used to be that, when you highlighted text in a complex script, as
            you extended the edges of the highlighted area you would break apart 
            combining characters from their base character, split ligatures and 
            disrupt the joining behaviour of Arabic script characters.</p>
          <p>The good news is that this no longer happens ‚Äì it was fixed by the 
            new text frame code.  The bad news is that the highlighting still 
            happens character by character, rather than at grapheme boundaries ‚Äì 
            which can make it tricky to know whether you got the combining 
            characters or not.</p>
          <p style="float: right; width: 50%; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; color: orange">UPDATE: I hear from Kevin Brosnan that the following will be fixed in Firefox 3.  Hurrah!  And thank you Mozilla team.</p>
          <p>What doesn‚Äôt appear to be fixed is the behaviour of asian scripts when the CSS text-align:justify is applied. üôÅ</p>
          <p>I raised a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=393051">bug report</a> about this.  I was amazed, after hearing about this from Indians and 
            Pakistanis too, that there didn‚Äôt seem to be a bug report already.  Come
            on users, don‚Äôt leave this up to the W3C!</p>
          <p>Basically, the issue is that if you apply text-align: justify to some
            text in an Indian or Tibetan script the combining characters all get 
            rendered alongside their base characters, ie. you go from this (showing,
            respectively, tibetan, devanagari (hindi and nepali), punjabi, telegu 
            and thai text):</p>
          <p><img src="r12a_blog_files/textalignnone.gif" alt="Picture of text with no alignment."></p>
          <p>to this:</p>
          <p><img src="r12a_blog_files/textalignjustify.gif" alt="Picture of text with justify alignment."></p>
          <p>Strangely the effect doesn‚Äôt seem to apply to the Thai text, nor to other text with combining characters that I‚Äôve tried.</p>
          <p>That‚Äôs a pretty big bug for people in the affected region because it effectively means that text-align:justify can‚Äôt be used.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Urdu IDNs</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Mon 30 Jul 2007 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Sarmad Hussain, at the Center for Research in Urdu Language 
            Processing FAST National University, Pakistan, is looking at enabling 
            Urdu IDNs based on ICANN recommendations, but this may lead to similar 
            approaches in a number of other countries.</p>
          <p>Sarmad writes: ‚ÄúWe are trying to make the URL enabled in Urdu for 
            people who are not literate in any other language (a large majority of 
            literate population in Pakistan).  ICANN has only given specs for the 
            Domain Name in other languages (through its RFCs).  Until they allow the
            TLDs in Urdu, we are considering an application end solution: have a 
            plug in for a browser for people who want to use it, which URL in Urdu, 
            strips and maps all the TLD information to .com, .pk, etc. and converts 
            the domain name to punycode Thus, people can type URLs in pure Urdu 
            which are converted to the mixed English-Urdu URLs by the application 
            layer which ICANN currently allows.‚Äù</p>
          <p>‚ÄúWe are currently trying to figure out what would be the ‚Äòacademic‚Äô 
            requirements/solutions for a language.  To practically solve the 
            problem, organizations like ICANN would need to come up with the 
            solutions.‚Äù</p>
          <p>There are some aspects to Sarmad‚Äôs proposal, arising from the nature 
            of the Arabic script used for Urdu, that raise some interesting 
            questions about the way IDN works for this kind of language. These have 
            to do with the choice of characters allowed in a domain name. For 
            example, there is a suggestion that users should be able to use certain 
            characters when writing a URI in Urdu which are then either removed (eg.
            vowel diacritics) or converted to other characters (eg. Arabic 
            characters) during the conversion to punycode.</p>
          <p>This is not something that is normally relevant for English-only 
            URIs, because of the relative simplicity of our alphabet.  There is much
            more potential ambiguity in Urdu for use of characters. Note, however, 
            that the proposals Sarmad is making are <em>language</em>-specific, not 
            script-specific, ie. Arabic or Persian (also written with the Arabic 
            script) would need some slightly different rules.</p>
          <p>I find myself wondering whether you could use a plug-in to strip out 
            or convert the characters while converting to punycode. People typing 
            IDNs in Urdu would need to be aware of the need for a plug-in, and would
            still need to know how to type in IDNs if they found themselves using a
            browser that didn‚Äôt have the plug-in (eg. the businessman who is 
            visiting a corporation in the US that prevents ad hoc downloads of 
            software).  On the one hand, I wonder whether we can expect a user who 
            sees a URI on a hard copy brochure containing vowel diacritics to know 
            what to do if their browser or mail client doesn‚Äôt support the plug-in. 
            On the other hand, a person writing a clickable URI in HTML or an email
            would not be able to guarantee that users would have access to the 
            plug-in.  In that case, they would be unwise to use things like short 
            vowel diacritics, since the user cannot easily change the link if they 
            don‚Äôt have a plug-in.  Imagine a vowelled IDN coming through in a plain 
            text email, for example: the reader may need to edit the email text to 
            get to the resource rather than just click on it.  Not likely to be 
            popular.</p>
          <p>Another alternative is to do such removal and conversion of 
            characters as part of the standard punycode conversion process.  This, I
            suspect, would necessitate every browser to have access to standardised
            tables of characters that should be ignored or converted for any 
            language.  But there is an additional problem in that the language would
            need to be determined correctly before such rules were applied ‚Äì that 
            is, the language of the original URI.  That too seems a bit difficult.</p>
          <p>So I can see the problem, but I‚Äôm not sure what the solution would 
            be. I‚Äôm inclined to think that creating a plug-in might create more 
            trouble than benefit, by replacing the problems of errors and 
            ambiguities with the problems of uninteroperable IDNs.</p>
          <p>I have posted this to the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/">www-international</a> list for discussion.</p>
          <p>Follow this link to see lists of characters that may be removed or converted.<br>

            <span class="caption">Ruby text above and below Japanese characters.</span></p>
          <p>My last post mentioned an extension that takes care of Thai line breaking.  In this post I want to point to another useful <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1935">extension that handles ruby annotation</a>.</p>
          <p>Typically ruby is used in East Asian scripts to provide phonetic 
            transcriptions of obscure characters, or characters that the reader is 
            not expected to be familiar with. For example it is widely used in 
            education materials and children‚Äôs texts. It is also occasionally used 
            to convey information about the meaning of ideographic characters.  For 
            more information see <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/ruby/">Ruby Markup and Styling</a>.</p>
          <p>Ruby markup (called ÊåØ„Çä‰ªÆÂêç [furigana] in Japan) is described by the W3C‚Äôs <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ruby/">Ruby Annotation</a> spec. It comes in two flavours, simple and complex.</p>
          <p>Ruby markup is a part of XHTML 1.1 (served as XML), but native 
            support is not widely available. IE doesn‚Äôt support XHTML 1.1, but it 
            does support <em>simple</em> ruby markup in HTML and XHTML 1.0.  This extension provides support in Firefox for <em>both</em> simple <em>and</em> complex ruby, in HTML, XHTML 1.0 and XHTML 1.1.</p>
          <p>It passes all the I18n Activity <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tests/sec-ruby-markup-0">ruby tests</a>, with the exception of one *very* minor nit related to spacing of complex ruby annotation.</p>

          <p>Samphan Raruenrom has produced a <a href="http://www.osdev.co.th/download/mozilla/extension/moztle-win-0.1.1.xpi">Firefox extension</a> based on ICU to handle Thai line breaking.</p>
          <p>Thai line breaks respect word boundaries, but there are no spaces 
            between words in written Thai. Spaces are used instead as phrase 
            separators (like English comma and full stop). This means that 
            dictionary-based lookup is needed to properly wrap Thai text.</p>
          <p>The current release works on Windows and the current Firefox release,
            2.0.0.4. The next release will also support Linux and will support 
            future Mozilla Firefox/Thunderbird releases.</p>
          <p>You can test this on our <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/11/Translations/Query?lang=th&amp;i18n=i18n-tutorials">i18n  articles translated into Thai</a>.</p>
          <p>This replaces work on a separate Thai version of Firefox.</p>

          <p><strong>UPDATE: This post has now been updated, reviewed and released as part of a W3C article. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names">http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names</a>.</strong></p>
          <p>Here are some more thoughts on dealing with multi-cultural names in web forms, databases, or ontologies. See <a href="http://r12a.github.io/blog/?p=100">the previous post</a>.</p>
          <h3>Script</h3>
          <p>The first thing that English speakers must remember about other 
            people‚Äôs names is that a large majority of them don‚Äôt use the Latin 
            alphabet, and a majority of those that <em>do</em> use accents and 
            characters that don‚Äôt occur in English.  It seems obvious, once I‚Äôve 
            said it, but it has some important consequences for designers that are 
            often overlooked.</p>
          <p>If you are designing an English form you need to decide whether you 
            are expecting people to enter names in their own script or in an 
            ASCII-only transcription.  What people will type into the form will 
            often depend on whether the form and its page is in their language or 
            not.  If the page is in their language, don‚Äôt be surprised to get back 
            non-Latin or accented Latin characters.</p>
          <p><strong>If you hope to get ASCII-only, you need to tell the user.</strong></p>
          <p>The decision about which is most appropriate will depend to some 
            extent on what you are collecting people‚Äôs names for, and how you intend
            to use them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Are you collecting the person‚Äôs name just to have an identifier in 
              your system?  If so, it may not matter whether the name is stored in 
              ASCII-only or native script.</li>
            <li>Or do you plan to call them by name on a welcome page or in 
              correspondence?  If you will correspond using their name on pages 
              written in their language, it would seem sensible to have the name in 
              the native script.</li>
            <li>Is it important for people in your organization who handle queries 
              to be able to recognise and use the person‚Äôs name?  If so, you may want 
              to ask for a transcription.</li>
            <li>Will their name be displayed or searchable (for example Flickr 
              optionally shows people‚Äôs names as well as their user name on their 
              profile page)?  If so, you may want to store the name in both ASCII and 
              native script, in which case you probably need to ask the user to submit
              their name in both native script and ASCII-only form, using separate 
              fields.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note that if you intend to parse a name, you may need to use country 
            or language-specific algorithms to do so correctly (see the <a href="http://r12a.github.io/blog/?p=100">previous blog</a> on personal names).</p>
          <p><strong>If you do accept non-ASCII names, you should use UTF-8 
            encoding in your pages, your back end databases and in all the scripts 
            in between.</strong> This will significantly simplify your life.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Dealing with the UTF-8 signature</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Fri 13 Jul 2007 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=codenotes">codenotes</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=web">web</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Some applications insert a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark">signature or Byte Order Mark (BOM)</a> at the beginning of UTF-8 text. For example, Notepad always adds a BOM when saving as UTF-8.</p>
          <p>Older text editors or browsers will display the BOM as a blank line 
            on-screen, others will display unexpected characters, such as √Ø¬ª¬ø.  This
            may also occur in the latest browsers if a file that starts with a BOM 
            is included into another file by PHP.</p>
          <p>For more information, see the article <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-utf8-bom.en.php">Unexpected characters or blank lines</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tests/sec-utf8-signature-0">test pages</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tests/results/results-utf8-signature">results</a> on the W3C site.</p>
          <p>If you have problems that you think might be related to this, the following may help.</p>
          <h3>Checking for the BOM</h3>
          <p>I created a <a href="http://r12a.github.io/utils/bomtester/">small utility</a> that checks for a BOM at the beginning of a file. Just type in the URI 
            for the file and it will take a look. (Note, if it‚Äôs a file included by 
            PHP that you think is causing the problem, type in the URI of the <em>included </em>file.)</p>
          <h3>Removing the BOM</h3>
          <p>If there is a BOM, you will probably want to remove it.  One way 
            would be to save the file using a BOM-aware editor that allows you to 
            specify that you don‚Äôt want a BOM at the start of the file.  For 
            example, if Dreamweaver detects a BOM the Save As dialogue box will have
            a check mark alongside the text ‚ÄúInclude Unicode Signature (BOM)‚Äù. Just
            uncheck the box and save.</p>
          <p>Another way would be to run a script on your file.  Here is some 
            simple Perl scripting to check for a BOM and remove it if it exists 
            (developed by Martin D√ºrst and tweaked a little by myself).</p>
          <pre># program to remove a leading UTF-8 BOM from a file

    print STDERR "Too many arguments!\n";
    exit;
    }

my $lineno = 0;

my $filename = @ARGV[0];
if ($filename) {
    open( BOMFILE, $filename ) || die "Could not open source file for reading.";

                print "BOM found and removed.\n";
