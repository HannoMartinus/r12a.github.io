        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="mainPicture"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/mongolian-variants/"><img src="r12a_blog_files/Screen-Shot-2016-12-14-at-15_002.png" alt="Picture of the page in action."></a></p>
          <p>The page <a class="mainLink" href="https://r12a.github.io/mongolian-variants/">Mongolian variant forms</a> has been significantly changed and moved to a new location. The main changes include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The ‚ÄòNP‚Äô column is now the ‚ÄòDS01‚Äô column. It shows the shapes discussed by the mongolian experts on the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-mongolian/">public-i18n-mongolian@w3.org</a> list with a view to updating and standardising the results of using 
              Unicode variants. The column reflects the state of that document as of 
              25 Nov 2016. Expected updates to the document are shown using ‚Äú[current]
              ‚â´ [expected]‚Äù.  As those and other changes are made to DS01 I will 
              update this variant comparison page.</li>
            <li>I added a column for L2/16-309 (the output of the Hohot discussions)
              as of 26 Oct 2016.  Differences between DS01 and L2/16-309 are all 
              highlighted for quick reference.</li>
            <li>I also added a column for the Unicode Standard v9 chart data, and 
              again highlighted differences from DS01 or L2/16-309. To see this 
              column, click on the vertical blue bar, bottom right, then set Hidden 
              Columns to Show.</li>
            <li>Showing the hidden columns also shows a usage column and a notes<br>
              column (information in both cases taken from L2/16-309).</li>
            <li>All the font information has been rechecked, and some bugs fixed.</li>
            <li>Other editorial changes include the hiding of former notes, and the<br>
              simplification and update of the page intro.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mainPicture"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/mongolian-variants/shape-index"><img src="r12a_blog_files/Screen-Shot-2016-12-14-at-15.png" alt="Picture of the page in action." style="max-width: 500px;"></a></p>
          <p>Another significant development is the creation of a <a class="mainLink" href="https://r12a.github.io/mongolian-variants/shape-index">Shape Index</a>.
            That document lists all shapes used in the page Mongolian Variants, and
            enables you to jump to the appropriate table in that page so that you 
            can see how it‚Äôs used.</p>
          <p>The classification used is not intended to be etymologically or 
            philosophically pure. It is intended as a simple practical tool to help 
            locate shapes, and one that also works for novices.</p>
          <p>I hope these changes will help us identify and resolve the remaining 
            differences between the documents. I will update these pages as the 
            source documents change (please advise me when new versions are 
            developed).  Of course, comments are welcome.</p>

          <p>Some more notes for future reference.  The following scripts in Unicode 9.0 have both upper and lower case characters.</p>

          <p>I include characters used for phonetic transcriptions in Latin.</p>
          <p>There are also case correspondences in the following Unicode blocks: 
            Number Forms, Enclosed Alphanumerics, Alphabetic Presentation Forms, 
            Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms. Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols also 
            has both upper and lower case forms, but they are not convertible, one 
            to the other.</p>
          <p>* Cherokee is quite unusual, in that until Unicode version 8 there were no lowercase Unicode characters, and Cherokee was written using only what are now referred to as uppercase letters. The lowercase letters had been used in the Cherokee New Testament, and are beginning to see more use in modern text too (which is why they were added to Unicode), but the overwhelming majority of pre-existing Cherokee text is still written using the 'uppercase' letters. Furthermore, many Cherokee fonts still only support the uppercase forms.</p>
<p>** Georgian is a little special, too.  Like Cherokee, the archaic, liturgical <em>Khutsuri</em> version of the script is bicameral, with <em>asomtravruli</em> capitals and <em>nuskhuri</em> lowercase. A new 
            attempt was made to write Georgian in a bicameral way in the 1950s, using <em>asomtavruli</em> capitals and <em>mkhedruli</em> lowercase, but it 
            didn‚Äôt catch on. For modern Georgian text, caseless <a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-charuse/?language=ka"><em>Mkhedruli</em> characters</a> are now the standard, however Unicode 11 added a set of <em>mtavruli</em> characters with case mappings to <em>mkedruli</em>. The mtavruli letters are have similar forms to the mkhedruli except that, in principle, all letters written in the mtavruli style appear with an equal height standing on the baseline, similar to small caps in the Latin script. These are never used for sentence- or word-initial uppercasing, only for the equivalent of ALL-CAPS, for example, in headings, signage, or emphasised text. <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/georgian/#mtavruli">Read more</a>.</p>
<p style="color:orange;font-size: 90%;font-style: italic;">Updated 27 Nov 2017: Added explanation for Cherokee, and expanded on Georgian explanation.</p>
<p style="color:orange;font-size: 90%;font-style: italic;">Updated 8 Apr 2019: Updated Georgian to take into account changes in Unicode 11.</p>

			<p>Yes, indeed. Hmmm.  I used <a href="http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=%5B:General_Category=Uppercase_Letter:%5D" rel="nofollow">http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=%5B:General_Category=Uppercase_Letter:%5D</a> to find the cased letters, but it seems that that CLDR table doesn‚Äôt know about Adlam or Osage (which is also bicameral) :(.  I searched using UniView instead, and added Adlam and Osage to the list, plus a note about Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols. Thanks, Amir.</p>

          <p>A new <a class="mainLink" href="https://r12a.github.io/app-pinyin-phonetics/">Pinyin phonetics</a> web app is now available. As you type Hanyu pinyin in the top box, a phonetic transcription appears in the lower box.</p>
          <p>I put this app together to help me get closer to the correct 
            pronunciation of names of people, cities, etc. that I come across while 
            reading about Chinese history. There was often some combination of 
            letters that I couldn‚Äôt quite remember how to pronounce.</p>
          <p>It‚Äôs not intended to be perfect, though I think it‚Äôs pretty good 
            overall. It works with input whether or not it has tonal accents. If you
            can suggest improvements, please <a href="https://github.com/r12a/app-pinyin-phonetics/issues/">raise a github issue</a>.</p>
          <p>See the <a href="https://r12a.github.io/app-pinyin-phonetics/notes">notes file</a> for a description of the less obvious phonetic symbols.</p>
          <p>In case you want something to play with, here‚Äôs the text in the 
            picture: D√¨z√†o zhƒìnzh√®ng qu√°nqi√∫ t≈çngx√≠ng de w√†nw√©iw«éng.  It means 
            ‚ÄúMaking the World Wide Web truly worldwide‚Äù, and the Han version is

          <p>A new <a class="mainLink" href="http://r12a.github.io/pickers/persian/">Persian Character Picker</a> web app is now available. The picker allows you to produce or analyse 
            runs of Persian text using the Arabic script. Character pickers are 
            especially useful for people who don‚Äôt know a script well, as characters
            are displayed in ways that aid identification.</p>
          <p>The picker is able to produce UN transcriptions of the text in the 
            box. The transcription appears just below the input box, where you can 
            copy it, move it into the input box at the caret, or delete it. In order
            to obtain a full transcription it is necessary to add short vowel 
            diactritics to places that could have more than one pronunciation, but 
            the picker can work out the vowels needed for many letter combinations.</p>

          <p><em>These are notes culled from various places. There may well be 
            some copy-pasting involved, but I did it long enough ago that I no 
            longer remember all the sources.  But these are notes, it‚Äôs not an 
            article.</em></p>
          <p>Case conversions are not always possible in Unicode by applying an 
            offset to a codepoint, although this can work for the ASCII range by 
            adding 32, or by adding 1 for many other characters in the Latin 
            extensions. There are many cases where the corresponding cased character
            is in another block, or in an irregularly offset location.</p>
          <p>In addition, there are linguistic issues that mean that simple 
            mappings of one character to another are not sufficient for case 
            conversion.</p>
          <p>In German, the uppercase of √ü is SS. German and Greek cannot, 
            however, be easily transformed from upper to lower case: German because 
            SS could be converted either to √ü or ss, depending on the word; Greek 
            because all tonos marks are omitted in upper case, eg. does ŒëŒòŒóŒùŒë 
            convert to ŒëŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩŒ¨ (the goddess) or ŒëŒ∏ŒÆŒΩŒ± (capital of Greece)? German may 
            also uppercase √ü to ·∫û sometimes for things like signboards.</p>
          <p>Also Greek converts uppercase sigma to either a final or non-final 
            form, depending on the position in a word, eg. ŒüŒîŒ•Œ£Œ£ŒïŒ•Œ£ becomes 
            ŒøŒ¥œÖœÉœÉŒµœÖœÇ. This contextual difference is easy to manage, however, 
            compared to the lexical issues in the previous paragraph.</p>
          <p>In Serbo-Croatian there is an important distinction between uppercase
            and titlecase. The single letter «Ü converts to «Ñ when the whole word is
            uppercased, but «Ö when titlecased.  Both of these forms revert to «Ü in 
            lowercase, so there is no ambiguity here.</p>
          <p>In Dutch, the titlecase of ijsvogel is IJsvogel, ie. which commonly 
            means that the first two letters have to be titlecased. There is a 
            single character ƒ≤ (<span class="uname">U+0132 LATIN CAPITAL LIGATURE IJ</span>)
            in Unicode that will behave as expected, but this single character is 
            very often not available on a keyboard, and so the word is commonly 
            written with the two letters I+J.</p>
          <p>In Greek, tonos diacritics are dropped during uppercasing, but not 
            dialytika. Greek diphthongs with tonos over the first vowel are 
            converted during uppercasing to  no tonos but a dialytika over the 
            second vowel in the diphthong, eg. ŒùŒµœÅŒ¨ŒπŒ¥Œ± becomes ŒùŒïŒ°ŒëŒ™ŒîŒë. A letter 
            with both tonos and dialytika above drops the tonos but keeps the 
            dialytika, eg. ŒµœÖœÜœÖŒêŒ± becomes ŒïŒ•Œ¶Œ•Œ™Œë. Also, contrary to the initial rule
            mentioned here, Greek does not drop the tonos on the disjunctive eta 
            (usually meaning ‚Äòor‚Äô), eg. ŒÆœÉŒøœÖŒΩ ŒÆ ŒµŒ≥œé ŒÆ ŒµœÉœç becomes ŒóŒ£ŒüŒ•Œù Œâ ŒïŒìŒ© Œâ ŒïŒ£Œ• 
            (note that the initial eta is not disjunctive, and so does drop the 
            tonos). This is to maintain the distinction between ‚Äòeither/or‚Äô ŒÆ from 
            the Œ∑ feminine form of the article, in the nominative case, singular 
            number.</p>
          <p>Greek titlecased vowels, ie. a vowel at the start of a word that is uppercased, retains its tonos accent, eg. ŒåŒºŒ∑œÅŒøœÇ.</p>
          <p>Turkish, Azeri, Tatar and Bashkir pair dotted and undotted i‚Äôs, which
            requires special handling for case conversion, that is 
            language-specific. For example, the name of the second largest city in 
            Turkey is ‚ÄúDiyarbakƒ±r‚Äù, which contains both the dotted and dotless 
            letters i. When rendered into upper case, this word appears like this: 
            Dƒ∞YARBAKIR.</p>
          <p>Lithuanian also has language-specific rules that retain the dot over i
            when combined with accents, eg. iÃáÃÄ iÃáÃÅ iÃáÃÉ, whereas the capital I has 
            no dot.</p>
          <p>Sometimes European French omits accents from uppercase letters, 
            whereas French Canadian typically does not. However, this is more of a 
            stylistic than a linguistic rule. Sometimes French people uppercase ≈ì to
            OE, but this is mostly due to issues with lack of keyboard support, it 
            seems (as is the issue with French accents).</p>
          <p>Capitalisation may ignore leading symbols and punctuation for a word,
            and titlecase the first casing letter.  This applies not only to 
            non-letters. A letter such as the (non-casing version of the) glottal 
            stop,  î, may be ignored at the start of a word, and the following letter
            titlecased, in IPA or Americanist phonetic transcriptions. (Note that, 
            to avoid confusion, there are separate case paired characters available 
            for use in orthographies such as Chipewyan, Dogrib and Slavey. These are
            …Å and …Ç.)</p>
          <p>Another issue for titlecasing is that not all words in a sequence are
            necessarily titlecased. German uses capital letters to start noun 
            words, but not verbs or adjectives. French and Italian may expect to 
            titlecase the ‚ÄòA‚Äô in ‚ÄúL‚ÄôAction‚Äù, since that is the start of a word. In 
            English, it is common not to titlecase words like ‚Äòfor‚Äô, ‚Äòof‚Äô, ‚Äòthe‚Äô and
            so forth in titles.</p>
          <p>Unicode provides only algorithms for generic case conversion and case
            folding. CLDR provides some more detail, though it is hard to 
            programmatically achieve all the requirements for case conversion.</p>
          <p>Case folding is a way of converting to a standard sequence of 
            (lowercase) characters that can be used for comparisons of strings. 
            (Note that this sequence may not represent normal lowercase text: for 
            example, both the uppercase Greek sigma and lowercase final sigma are 
            converted to a normal sigma, and the German √ü is converted to ‚Äòss‚Äô.)  
            There are also different flavours of case folding available: common, 
            full, and simple.</p>

			<p>‚ÄúSometimes French Canadian omits accents from uppercase letters, whereas French typically does not.‚Äù  It‚Äôs the converse actually.  And the reason is the same as for ≈ì: keyboard support.  French keyboards lack accented uppercase, whereas French Canadian ones provide them (shift + whatever produces the accented lowercase).</p>
<p>This difference goes back to mechanical typewriter keyboards, so it‚Äôs not that recent using human generations as a yardstick.  It has been around long enough that numerous French people believe that uppercase should not be accented (which is totally wrong), sometimes having been thought that in school!</p>

			<p>‚ÄúIn Dutch, the titlecase of ijsland is IJsland, ie. the first two letters have to be titlecased.‚Äù</p>
<p>Two points here. Strictly speaking, IJ is a single character U+0132: ƒ≤, and its lower case character is +0133: ƒ≥, although they are often typed as two characters I J and i j because (as with the French examples above) the single character versions are not on the keyboard. However, if you spell IJsland out loud, you always spell it with 6 letters, not seven. IJ is always considered a single letter no matter how it is typed.</p>
<p>A nit-pick: IJsland is a proper noun, and so doesn‚Äôt have a lower-cased version. You could use IJsvogel (kingfisher)</p>

          <p>An updated version of the <a class="mainLink" href="http://r12a.github.io/apps/conversion/">Unicode Character Converter</a> web app is now available. This app allows you to convert characters between various different formats and notations. </p>
          <p>Significant changes include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It‚Äôs now possible to generate EcmaScript6 style escapes for 
              supplementary characters in the JavaScript output field, eg. \u{10398} 
              rather than \uD800\uDF98.</li>
            <li>In many cases, clicking on a checkbox option now applies the change 
              straight away if there is content in the associated output field. (There
              are 4 output fields where this doesn‚Äôt happen because we aren‚Äôt dealing
              with escapes and there are problems with spaces and delimiters.)</li>
            <li>By default, the JavaScript output no longer escapes the ASCII 
              characters that can be represented by \n, \r, \t, \‚Äô and \‚Äù.  A new 
              checkbox is provided to force those transformations if needed. This 
              should make the JS transform much more useful for general conversions.</li>
            <li>The code to transform to HTML/XML can now replace RLI, LRI, FSI and PDI if the <samp translate="no">Convert bidi controls to HTML markup</samp> option is set.</li>
            <li>The code to transform to HTML/XML can convert many more invisible or ambiguous characters to escapes if the <samp translate="no">Escape invisible characters</samp> option is set.</li>
            <li>UTF-16 code points are all at least 4 digits long.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug related to U+00A0 when converting to HTML/XML.</li>
            <li>The order of the output fields was changed, and various small improvements were made to the user interface.</li>
            <li>Revamped and updated the notes</li>

          <p><a class="mainLink" href="http://r12a.github.io/uniview/">UniView</a> now supports Unicode version 9, which is being released today, 
            including all changes made during the beta period. (As before, images 
            are not available for the Tangut additions, but the character 
            information is available.)</p>
          <p>This version of UniView also introduces a new filter feature.  Below 
            each block or range of characters is a set of links that allows you to 
            quickly highlight characters with the property <em>letter</em>, <em>mark</em>, <em>number</em>, <em>punctuation</em>, or <em>symbol</em>. For more fine-grained property distinctions, see the <span class="kw" translate="no">Filter</span> panel.</p>
          <p>In addition, for some blocks there are other links available that reflect tags assigned to characters. <strong>This tagging is far from exhaustive!</strong> For instance, clicking on <span class="kw" translate="no">sanskrit</span> will not show all characters used in Sanskrit.</p>
          <p>The tags are just intended to be an aid to help you find certain 
            characters quickly by exposing words that appear in the character 
            descriptions or block subsection titles. For example, if you want to 
            find the Bengali currency symbol while viewing the Bengali block, click 
            on <span class="kw" translate="no">currency</span> and all other characters but those related to currency will be dimmed.</p>
          <p>(Since the highlight function is used for this, don‚Äôt forget that, if
            you happen to highlight a useful subset of characters and want to work 
            with just those, you can use the <span class="kw" translate="no">Make list from highlights</span> command, or click on the upwards pointing arrow icon below the text area to move those characters into the text area.)</p>

          <p>This is a bit geeky, but after watching the Eurovision contest last 
            night and looking at the results this morning i began wondering what 
            would happen if you removed the skew that Eurovision adds to the raw 
            results to achieve their final order, ie. count all scores, not just the
            top 10 scores, and don‚Äôt add a boost to the top two scores (10 and 12 
            points). </p>
          <p>Here‚Äôs what i came up with, from the Eurovision published results. It
            allocates a score based on adding up the rankings produced for each 
            country, so the lower the score the better.</p>

          <p>Interesting to see that Russia was well ahead in the public vote, and
            Australia well behind (even behind Poland!). Ukraine actually came 
            second in all columns except for the actual result ‚Äì Australia would 
            have been the overall winner. Also, the UK did reasonably well in the 
            jury vote, and finished a little further from the bottom in the combined
            result than from the actual. Germany did slightly better in the public 
            vote than what is suggested by the other columns, thanks mainly to votes
            from Austria and Switzerland.</p>

          <p>This blog post introduces the first of a set of historical maps of 
            Europe that can be displayed at the same scale so that you can compare 
            political or ethnographic boundaries from one time to the next.  The 
            first set covers the period from 362 AD to 830 AD.</p>
          <p>A key aim here is to allow you to switch from map to map and see how boundaries evolve across an unchanging background.</p>
          <p>The information in the maps is derived mostly from information in 
            Colin McEvedy‚Äôs excellent series of  books, in particular (so far) <cite>The New Penguin Atlas of Medieval History</cite>, but also sometimes brings in information from the <cite>Times History of Europe</cite>.
            Boundaries are approximate for a number of reasons: first, in the 
            earlier times especially, the borders were only approximate anyway, 
            second, I have deduced the boundary information from small-scale maps 
            and (so far) only a little additional research, third, the sources 
            sometimes differ about where boundaries lay. I hope to refine the data 
            during future research, in the meantime take this information as <em>grosso modo</em>.</p>
          <p>The link below the picture takes you to a chronological summary of 
            events that lie behind the changes in the maps. Click on the large dates
            to open maps in a separate window. (Note that all maps will open in 
            that window, and you may have to ensure that it isn‚Äôt hidden behind the 
            chronology page.)</p>
          <p>The background to the SVG overlay is a map that shows relief and 
            rivers, as well as modern country boundaries (the dark lines). These 
            were things which, as good as McEvedy‚Äôs maps were, I was always missing 
            in order to get useful reference points.  Since the outlines and text 
            are created in SVG, you can zoom in to see details.</p>
          <p>This is just the first stage, and the maps are still largely first 
            drafts.  The plan is to refine the details for existing maps and add 
            many more.  So far we only deal with Europe. In the future I‚Äôd like to 
            deal with other places, if I can find sources.</p>

			<p>Thanks, Richard; these are very interesting! I‚Äôm intrigued to learn of many ancient cultures I never heard of, and even better to see their locations and movements on sequential charts. History illustrated and enlivened (especially with SVG)!  Makes me wonder what cultural or linguistic shadows still exist from these ancient peoples; I‚Äôm sure there are many.</p>
<p>I would love to see similar information for parts of the world not typically represented in American / European history lessons, e.g., Africa, Asia, South America. So much to learn ‚Ä¶</p>

          <p><a class="mainLink" href="http://r12a.github.io/uniview/">UniView</a> now supports the characters introduced for the beta version of Unicode 
            9. Any changes made during the beta period will be added when Unicode 9 
            is officially released. (Images are not available for the Tangut 
            additions, but the character information is available.)</p>
          <p>It also brings in notes for individual characters where those notes 
            exist, if Show notes is selected. These notes are not authoritative, but
            are provided in case they prove useful.</p>
          <p>A new icon was added below the text area to add commas between each character in the text area.</p>
          <p>Links to the help page that used to appear on mousing over a control 
            have been removed. Instead there is a noticeable, blue link to the help 
            page, and the help page has been reorganised and uses image maps so that
            it is easier to find information. The reorganisation puts more emphasis
            on learning by exploration, rather than learning by reading.</p>
          <p>Various tweaks were made to the user interface.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">More updates for the Egyptian hieroglyph picker</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Mon 7 Mar 2016 tagged as <a href="index?tag=apps">apps</a>, <a href="index?tag=pickers">pickers</a>, <a href="index?tag=egyptian">egyptian</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="mainPicture"><a href="http://r12a.github.io/pickers/egyptian/"><img src="r12a_blog_files/egyptian-picker-v19c.png" alt="Picture of the page in action."></a></p>
          <p>I‚Äôve been doing more work on the <a class="mainLink" href="http://r12a.github.io/pickers/egyptian/">Egyptian Hieroglyph picker</a> over the weekend. </p>
          <p>The data behind the keyword search has now been completely updated to
            reflect descriptions by Gardiner and Allen.  If you work with those 
            lists it should now be easy to locate hieroglyphs using keywords. The 
            search mechanism has also been rewritten so that you don‚Äôt need to type 
            keywords in a particular order for them to match. I also strip out 
            various common function words and do some other optimisation before 
            attempting a match.</p>
          <p>The other headline news is the addition of various controls above the
            text area, including one that will render MdC text as a two-dimensional
            arrangement of hieroglyphs.  To do this, I adapted WikiHiero‚Äôs PHP code
            to run in javascript. You can see an example of the output in the 
            picture attached to this post. If you want to try it, the MdC text to 
            put in the text area is:<br>
            <kdb>anx-G5-zmA:tA:tA-nbty-zmA:tA:tA-sw:t-bit:t-&lt; -zA-ra:.-mn:n-T:w-Htp:t*p-&gt;-anx-D:t:N17-!</kdb>
          </p>
          <p>The result should look like this:</p>
          <p><img src="r12a_blog_files/wikihiero_example.png" alt="Picture of hieroglyphs."></p>
          <p>Other new controls allow you to convert MdC text to hieroglyphs, and 
            vice versa, or to type in a Unicode phonetic transcription and find the 
            hieroglyphs it represents. (This may still need a little more work.)</p>
          <p>I also moved the help text from the notes area to a separate file, 
            with a nice clickable picture of the picker at the top that will link to
            particular features. You can get to that page by clicking on the blue <span class="kw" translate="no">Help</span> box near the bottom of the picker.</p>
          <p>Finally, you can now set the text area to display characters from right to left, in right-aligned lines, using <span class="kw" translate="no">more controls &gt; Output direction</span>.
            Unfortunately, i don‚Äôt know of a font that under these conditions will 
            flip the hieroglyphs horizontally so that they face the right way.</p>
          <p>For more information about the new features, and how to use the picker, <a href="http://r12a.github.io/pickers/egyptian/help/">see the Help page</a>.<br>

          <p>Over the weekend I added a set of new features to the <a class="mainLink" href="http://r12a.github.io/pickers/egyptian/">picker for Egyptian Hieroglyphs</a>, aimed at making it easier to locate a particular hieroglyph. Here is a run-down of various methods now available.</p>
          <h3>Category-based input</h3>
          <p>This was the original method. Characters are grouped into standard 
            categories. Click on one of the orange characters, chosen as a nominal 
            representative of the class, to show below all the characters in that 
            category. Click on one of those to add it to the output box. As you 
            mouse over the orange characters, you‚Äôll see the name of the category 
            appear just below the output box.</p>
          <h3>Keyword-search-based input</h3>
          <p>The app associates most hieroglyphs with keywords that describe the 
            glyph. You can search for glyphs using those keywords in the input field
            labelled <code class="kw" translate="no">Search for</code>.</p>
          <p>Searching for <samp>ripple</samp> will match both <samp>ripple</samp> and <samp>ripples</samp>. Searching for <samp>king</samp> will match <samp>king</samp> and <samp>walking</samp>. If you want to only match whole words, surround the search term with colons, ie.<samp> :ripple:</samp> or <samp>:king:</samp>.</p>
          <p>Note that the keywords are written in British English, so you need to look for <samp>sceptre</samp> rather than <samp>scepter</samp>.</p>
          <p>The search input is treated as a regular expression, so if you want 
            to search for two words that may have other words between them, use <samp>.*</samp>. For example,<samp> ox .* palm</samp> will match <samp>ox horns with stripped palm branch</samp>.</p>
          <p>Many of the hieroglyphs have also been associated with keywords related to their use. If you select <code class="kw" translate="no">Include usage</code>,
            these keywords will also be selected. Note that this keyword list is 
            not exhaustive by any means, but it may occasionally be useful. For 
            example, a search for Anubis  will produce ìÅ¢ ìÉ¢ ìÉ£ ìÉ§ .</p>
          <p>(Note: to search for a character based on the Unicode name for that character, eg. <samp>w004</samp>, use the search box in the yellow area.)</p>
          <h3>Searching for pronunciations</h3>
          <p>Many of the hieroglyphs are associated with 1, 2 or 3 consonant pronunciations. These can be looked up as follows.</p>
          <p>Type the sequence of consonants into the output box and highlight them. Then click on <code class="kw" translate="no">Look up from Latin</code>.
            Hieroglyphs that match that character or sequence of characters will be
            displayed below the output box, and can be added to the output box by 
            clicking on them. (Note that if you still have the search string 
            highlighted in the output box those characters will be replaced by the 
            hieroglyph.)</p>
          <p>You will find the panel <code class="kw" translate="no">Latin characters</code> useful for typing characters that are not accessible via your keyboard. The panel is displayed by clicking on the higher <code class="kw" translate="no">L</code> in the grey bar to the left. Click on a character to add it to the output area.</p>
          <p>For example, if you want to obtain the hieroglyph ìéù, which is 
            represented by the 3-character sequence wÍú£·∏•, add wÍú£·∏• to the output area 
            and select it. Then click on <code class="kw" translate="no">Latin characters</code>.
            You will see the character you need just above the SPACE button. Click 
            on that hieroglyph and it will replace the wÍú£·∏• text in the output area. 
            (Unhighlight the text in the output area if you want to keep both and 
            add the hierglyph at the cursor position.)</p>
          <h3>Input panels accessed from the vertical grey bar</h3>
          <p>The vertical grey bar to the left allows you to turn on/off a number of panels that can help create the text you want.</p>
          <p><span class="leadin">Latin characters.</span> This panel displays 
            Latin characters you are likely to need for transcription. It is 
            particularly useful for setting up a search by pronunciation (see 
            above).</p>
          <p><span class="leadin">Latin to Egyptian.</span> This panel also 
            displays Latin characters used for transcription, but when you click on 
            them they insert hieroglyphs into the output area. These are 24 
            hieroglyphs represented by a single consonant. Think of it as a shortcut
            if you want to find 1-consonant hieroglyphs by pronunciation.</p>
          <p>Where a single consonant can be represented by more than one 
            hieroglyph, a small pop-up will present you with the available choices. 
            Just click on the one you want.</p>
          <p><span class="leadin">Egyptian alphabet.</span> This panel  displays 
            the 26 hieroglyphs that the previous panel produces as hieroglyphs. In 
            many cases this is the quickest way of typing in these hieroglyphs.</p>

          <p>I have just published a <a class="mainLink" href="http://r12a.github.io/pickers/egyptian/">picker for Egyptian Hieroglyphs</a>.</p>
          <p>This Unicode character picker allows you to produce or analyse runs of Egyptian Hieroglyph text using the Latin script.</p>
          <p>Characters are grouped into standard categories. Click on one of the 
            orange characters, chosen as a nominal representative of the class, to 
            show below all the characters in that category. Click on one of those to
            add it to the output box. As you mouse over the orange characters, 
            you‚Äôll see the name of the category appear just below the output box.</p>
          <p>Just above the orange characters you can find buttons to insert RLO 
            and PDF controls.  RLO will make the characters that follow it to 
            progress from right to left. Alternatively, you can select <span class="kw">more controls</span> &gt; <span class="kw">Output direction</span> to set the direction of the output box to RTL/LTR override. The latter 
            approach will align the text to the right of the box. I haven‚Äôt yet 
            found a Unicode font that also flips the glyphs horizontally as a 
            result. I‚Äôm not entirely sure about the best way to apply directionality
            to Egyptian hieroglyphs, so I‚Äôm happy to hear suggestions.</p>
          <p>Alongside the direction controls are some characters used for markup 
            in the Manuel de Codage, which allows you to prepare text for an engine 
            that knows how to lay it out two-dimensionally.  (The picker doesn‚Äôt do 
            that.)</p>
          <p>The Latin Characters panel, opened from the grey bar to the left, provides characters needed for transcription.</p>
          <p>In case you‚Äôre interested, here is the text you can see in the 
            picture. (You‚Äôll need a font to see this, of course. Try the free <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto Sans font</a>, if you don‚Äôt have one ‚Äì or copy-paste these lines into the picker, where you have a webfont.)<br>

			<p>Great addition, Richard!<br>
Unicode is awesome üôÇ</p>
<p>The last couple of paragraphs, with the example, made me think that many people (me included) really appreciate samples of the language/script, especially in the form of historical or scientific details or curiosities‚Ä¶ I mean that when talking about such an esoteric script, one really wants to learn a little bit more, and see what the language looks like, how it‚Äôs composed‚Ä¶ Those comments make the post more enjoyable, for those who are curious about languages and glyphs. So, more of that, please! üôÇ</p>

          <h2 class="post-title"><a href="index?p=1633" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: What characters are in or not in encoding X?">What characters are in or not in encoding X?</a></h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Thu 14 Jan 2016 tagged as <a href="index?tag=apps">apps</a>, <a href="index?tag=docs">docs</a>, <a href="index?tag=unicode">unicode</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I just received a query from someone who wanted to know how to 
            figure out what characters are in and what characters are not in a 
            particular legacy character encoding. So rather than just send the 
            information to her I thought I‚Äôd write it as a blog post so that others 
            can get the same information. I‚Äôm going to write this quickly, so let me
            know if there are parts that are hard to follow, or that you consider 
            incorrect, and I‚Äôll fix it.</p>
          <p>A few preliminary notes to set us up: When I refer to ‚Äòlegacy 
            encodings‚Äô, I mean any character encoding that isn‚Äôt UTF-8. Though, 
            actually, I will only consider those that are specified in the <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/">Encoding spec</a>,
            and I will use the data provided by that spec to determine what 
            characters each encoding contains (since that‚Äôs what it aims to do for 
            Web-based content).  You may come across other implementations of a 
            given character encoding, with different characters in it, but bear in 
            mind that those are unlikely to work on the Web.</p>
          <p>Also, the tools I will use refer to a given character encoding using the preferred name. You can use the <a target="_blank" href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels">table in the Encoding spec</a> to map alternative names to the preferred name I use.</p>
          <h3>What characters are in encoding X?</h3>
          <p>Let‚Äôs suppose you want to know what characters are in the character encoding you know as <span class="kw" translate="no">cseucpkdfmtjapanese</span>. A quick check in the Encoding spec shows that the preferred name for this encoding is <span class="kw" translate="no">euc-jp</span>.</p>
          <p>Go to <a href="http://r12a.github.io/apps/encodings/" target="_blank">http://r12a.github.io/apps/encodings/</a> and look for the selection control near the bottom of the page labelled <span class="kw" translate="no">show all the characters in this encoding</span>.</p>
          <p>Select <span class="kw" translate="no">euc-jp</span>. It opens a new window that shows you all the characters.</p>
          <p><img src="r12a_blog_files/euc-jp-characters.png" alt="picture of the result" style="width: 80%; border-radius:8px; border: 1px solid #ccc;  box-shadow: -15px 15px 15px #ccc;"></p>
          <p>This is impressive, but so large a list that it‚Äôs not as useful as it could be.</p>
          <p>So highlight and copy all the characters in the text area and go to <a href="https://r12a.github.io/apps/listcharacters/" target="_blank">https://r12a.github.io/apps/listcharacters/</a>.</p>
          <p>Paste the characters into the big empty box, and hit the button <span class="kw" translate="no">Analyse characters above</span>.</p>
          <p>This will now list for you those same characters, but organised by 
            Unicode block.  At the bottom of the page it gives a total character 
            count, and adds up the number of Unicode blocks involved.</p>
          <p><img src="r12a_blog_files/euc-jp-chars-by-block.png" alt="picture of the result" style="width: 80%; border-radius:8px; border: 1px solid #ccc;  box-shadow: -15px 15px 15px #ccc;"></p>
          <h3>What characters are <strong>not</strong> in encoding X?</h3>
          <p>If instead you actually want to know what characters are <em>not</em> in the encoding for a given Unicode block you can follow these steps.</p>
          <p>Go to UniView (<a href="http://r12a.github.io/uniview/" target="_blank">http://r12a.github.io/uniview/</a>) and select the block you are interested where is says <span class="kw" translate="no">Show block</span>, or alternatively type the range into the control labelled <span class="kw" translate="no">Show range</span> (eg. 0370:03FF).</p>
          <p>Let‚Äôs imagine you are interested in Greek characters and you have 
            therefore selected the Greek and Coptic block (or typed 0370:03FF in the <span class="kw" translate="no">Show range</span> control).</p>
          <p>On the edit buffer area (top right) you‚Äôll see a small icon with an 
            arrow point upwards. Click on this to bring all the characters in the 
            block into the edit buffer area. Then hit the icon just to its left to 
            highlight all the characters and then copy them to the clipboard.</p>
          <p><img src="r12a_blog_files/chars-in-edit-buffer.png" alt="picture of the result" style="width: 80%; border-radius:8px; border: 1px solid #ccc;  box-shadow: -15px 15px 15px #ccc;"></p>
          <p>Next open <a href="http://r12a.github.io/apps/encodings/" target="_blank">http://r12a.github.io/apps/encodings/</a> and paste the characters into the input area labelled with <span class="kw" translate="no">Unicode characters to encode</span>, and hit the <span class="kw" translate="no">Convert</span> button.</p>
          <p><img src="r12a_blog_files/chars-not-in-encoding.png" alt="picture of the result" style="width: 40%; border-radius:8px; border: 1px solid #ccc;  box-shadow: -15px 15px 15px #ccc;"></p>
          <p>The Encoding converter app will list all the characters in a number 
            of encodings.  If the character is part of the encoding, it will be 
            represented as two-digit hex codes. If not, and this is what you‚Äôre 
            looking for, it will be represented as decimal HTML escapes (eg. 
            &amp;#880;). This way you can get the decimal code point values for all 
            the characters not in the encoding. (If all the characters exist in the 
            encoding, the block will turn green.)</p>
          <p>(If you want to see the list of characters, copy the results for the 
            encoding you are interested in, go back to UniView and paste the 
            characters into the input field labelled Find. Then click on Dec.  
            Ignore all ASCII characters in the list that is produced.)</p>
          <p>Note, by the way, that you can tailor the encodings that are shown by the Encoding converter by clicking on <span class="kw" translate="no">change encodings shown</span> and then selecting the encodings you are interested in.  There are 36 to choose from.</p>

          <p>Following closely on the heels of the Old Norse and Runic pickers comes a new Old English (Anglo-Saxon) picker. </p>
          <p>This Unicode character picker allows you to produce or analyse runs of Old English text using the Latin script.</p>
          <p>In addition to helping you to type Old English latin-based text, the 
            picker allows you to automatically generate phonetic and runic 
            transcriptions. These should be used with caution! The  transcriptions 
            are only intended to be a rough guide, and there may occasionally be 
            slight inaccuracies that need patching. </p>
          <p>The picture in this blog post shows examples of old english text, and
            phonetic and runic transcriptions of the same, from the beginning of 
            Beowulf. Click on it to see it larger, or copy-paste the following into 
            the picker, and try out the commands on the top right: Hw√¶t! wƒì GƒÅr-Dena

            identification. These pickers also provide tools to manipulate the text.</p>

            analyse runs of Runic text. It allows you to type in runes for the  
            Elder fu√æark, Younger fu√æark (both long-branch and short-twig variants),
            the Medieval fu√æark and the Anglo-Saxon fu√æork. To help beginners, each
            of the above has its own keyboard-style layout that associates the 
            runes with characters on the keyboard to make it easier to locate them.</p>
          <p>It can also produce a latin transliteration for a sequence of runes, 
            or automatically produce runes from a latin transliteration. (Note that 
            these transcriptions do not indicate pronunciation ‚Äì they are standard 
            latin substitutes for graphemes, rather than actual Old Norse or Old 
            English, etc, text. To convert Old Norse to runes, see the description 
            of the Old Norse pickers below. This will soon be joined by another 
            picker which will do the same for Anglo-Saxon runes.)</p>
          <p>Writing in runes is not an exact science. Actual runic text is 
            subject to many variations dependent on chronology, location and the 
            author‚Äôs idiosyncracies. It should be particularly noted that the 
            automated transcription tools provided with this picker are intended as 
            aids to speed up transcription, rather than to produce absolutely 
            accurate renderings of specific texts. The output may need to be tweaked
            to produce the desired results.</p>
          <p>You can use the RLO/PDF buttons below the keyboard to make the runic 
            text run right-to-left, eg. ‚ÄÆ·öπ·ö™·ö±·ö¶·ö∑·ö™‚Ä¨, and if you have the right font 
            (such as Junicode, which is included as the default webfont, or a 
            Babelstone font), make the glyphs face to the left also. The Bablestone 
            fonts also implement a number of bind-runes for Anglo-Saxon (but are 
            missing those for Old Norse) if you put a ZWJ character between the 
            characters you want to ligate. For example: ·öª‚Äç·õñ‚Äç·õö. You can also produce 
            two glyphs mirrored around the central stave by putting ZWJ between two 
            identical characters, eg. ·ö¢‚Äç·ö¢. (Click on the picture of the picker in 
            this blog post to see examples.)</p>

          <p><strong>The Old Norse picker</strong> allows you to produce or analyse runs of Old Norse text using the Latin script. It is based on a standardised orthography.</p>
          <p>In addition to helping you to type Old Norse latin-based text, the 
            picker allows you to automatically generate phonetic and runic 
            transcriptions. These should be used with caution! The phonetic 
            transcriptions are only intended to be a rough guide, and, as mentioned 
            earlier, real-life runic text is often highly idiosyncratic, not to 
            mention that it varies depending on the time period and region.</p>
          <p>The runic transcription tools in this app produce runes of the 
            Younger fu√æark ‚Äì used for Old Norse after the Elder and before the 
            Medieval fu√æarks. This transcription tool has its own idiosyncracies, 
            that may not always match real-life usage of runes. One particular 
            idiosyncracy is that the output always regularly conforms to the same 
            set of rules, but others include the decision not to remove homorganic 
            nasals before certain following letters. More information about this is 
            given in the notes.</p>
          <p>You can see an example of the output from these tools in the picture 
            of the Old Norse picker that is attached to this blog post. Here‚Äôs some 
            Old Norse text you can play with: <em lang="non">Ok sem lei√∞ at j√≥lum, 
            g√∏r√∞usk menn √æar √≥k√°tir. B«´√∞varr spur√∞i H«´tt hverju √æat s√¶tti; hann 
            sag√∞i honum at d√Ωr eitt hafi komit √æar tv√° vetr √≠ samt, mikit ok 
            √≥gurligt.</em></p>
          <p>The picker also has a couple of tools to help you work with A New Introduction to Old Norse.</p>
