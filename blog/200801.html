          <p>The major changes in this version relate to the way searching and 
            property-based lookup is done on characters in the lower left panel, and
            features for refining and capturing the resulting lists.</p>
          <p>Removed the two <span class="onscreen">Highlight</span> selection boxes. These used to highlight characters in the lower left panel with a specific property value. The <span class="onscreen">Show</span> selection box on the left (used to be <span class="onscreen">Show list</span>) now does that job if you set the <span class="onscreen">Local</span> checkbox alongside it. (Local is the default for this feature.)</p>
          <p>As part of that move, the former <span class="onscreen">SiR</span> (search in range) checkbox that used to be alongside <span class="onscreen">Custom range</span> has been moved below the <span class="onscreen">Search for</span> input field, and renamed to <span class="onscreen">Local</span>. If <span class="onscreen">Local</span> is checked, searching can now be done on any content in the lower left 
            panel, and the results are shown as highlighting, rather than a new 
            list.</p>
          <p>To complement these new highlighting capabilities, a new feature was added. If you click on the icon next to <span class="onscreen">Make list from highlights</span> the content of the lower left panel will be replaced by a list of just 
            those items that are currently highlighted – whether the highlighting 
            results from a search or a property listing. Note that this can also be 
            useful to refine searches: perform an initial search, convert the result
            to a list, then perform another search on that list, and so on.</p>
          <p>Finally got around to putting <img src="r12a_blog_files/apply.gif" alt=" " border="0" align="bottom"> icons after the pull-down lists. This means that if you want to 
            reapply, say, a block selection after doing something else, only one 
            click is needed (rather than having to choose another option, then 
            choose the original option). The effect of this on the ease of use of 
            UniView is much greater than I expected.</p>
          <p>Added an icon <img src="r12a_blog_files/tochar.png" alt=" " border="0" align="bottom"> to the text area. If you click on this, all the characters in the lower
            left panel are copied into the text area. This is very useful for 
            capturing the result of a search, or even a whole block. Note that if a 
            list in the lower left panel contains unassigned code points, these are 
            not copied to the text area.</p>
          <p>As a result of the above changes, the way <span class="onscreen">Show as graphics</span> and <span class="onscreen">Show range as list</span> work internally was essential rewritten, but users shouldn’t see the difference.</p>
          <p>Changed the label <span class="onscreen">Character area</span> to <span class="onscreen">Text area</span>.</p>

          <p>The main change in this version is the reworking of the former Cut 
            &amp; paste and Code point(s) fields to make it easier to use UniView as
            a generalised picker.</p>
          <p>Moved the <span class="onscreen">cut&amp;paste</span> field downwards, made it larger, and changed the label to <span class="onscreen">character area</span>.
            This should make it easier to deal with text copy/cut &amp; paste, and 
            more obvious that that is possible with UniView. It is much clearer now 
            that UniView provides character map/picker functionality, and not just 
            character lookup.</p>
          <p>Whereas previously you had to  double-click to put a character in the lower left pane into the <span class="onscreen">Cut&amp;paste</span> field, UniView now echoes characters to the <span class="onscreen">Character area</span> every time you (single) click on a character in the lower left hand 
            pane. This can be turned off. Double-clicking will still add the 
            codepoint of a character in the lower left panel to the <span class="onscreen">Code points</span> field.</p>
          <p>The <span class="onscreen">Character area</span> has its own set of 
            icons, some of which are new: ie. you can select the text, add a space, 
            and change the font of the text in the area (as well as turn the echo on
            and off). I also spruced up the icons on the UI in general.</p>
          <p>Note that on most browsers you can insert characters at the point in the <span class="onscreen">Character area</span> where you set the cursor, or you can overwrite a highlight range of 
            characters, whereas (because of the non-standard way it handles 
            selections and ranges) Internet Explorer will always add characters to 
            the end of the line.</p>
          <p>The <span class="onscreen">Code points</span> field has also been enlarged, and I moved the <span class="onscreen">Show list</span> pull-down to the left and <span class="onscreen">Show as graphics</span> and <span class="onscreen">Show page as list</span> to the right. This puts all the main commands for creating lists together on the left.</p>
          <p>When you mouse over character in the lower left pane you now see both
            hex and decimal codepoint information. (Previously you just saw an 
            unlabelled decimal number.) You will also find decimal code point values
            for characters displayed in the lower right panel.</p>
          <p>Fixed a bug in the <span class="onscreen">Code points</span> input 
            feature so that trailing spaces no longer produce errors, but also went 
            much further than that. You can now add random text containing 
            codepoints or most types of hex-based escaped characters to the input 
            field, and UniView will seek them out to create the list. For example, 
            if you paste the following into the <span class="onscreen">Code points</span> field:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>the decomposition mapping is &lt;U+CE20, U+11B8&gt;, and not &lt;U+110E, U+1173, U+11B8&gt;.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>the result will be:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>CE20:   츠  [Hangul Syllables] <br>
              11B8:   ᆸ  HANGUL JONGSEONG PIEUP <br>
              110E:   ᄎ  HANGUL CHOSEONG CHIEUCH <br>
              1173:   ᅳ  HANGUL JUNGSEONG EU <br>
              11B8:   ᆸ  HANGUL JONGSEONG PIEUP</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Of course, UniView is not able to tell that an ordinary word like 
            ‘Abba’ is not a hex codepoint, so you obviously need to watch out for 
            that and a few other situations, but much of the time this should make 
            it much easier to extract codepoint information.</p>
          <p>I still haven’t found a way to fix the display bug in Safari and 
            Google Chrome that causes initial content in the lower left pane to be 
            only partially displayed.</p>

          <p>Here are some lists of characters that are useful for normalization.  I’ll probably add some others later.</p>
          <p>The lists apply to Unicode version 5.1.</p>
          <p>The files below contain declarations for JavaScript sparse arrays.  
            They are easy enough to convert to other formats using global search and
            replace.  The verbose version provides character names and code points.</p>
          <h2>Combining characters with non-zero properties</h2>
          <p>Characters with non-zero combining properties are assigned to a 
            sparse array indexed by codepoint. The value gives the combining 
            property value.</p>

          <p>There are 498 of these.</p>
          <h2>Canonically decomposable characters for NFD</h2>
          <p>This list maps single characters to their decompositions. The single 
            character is referenced by an index into the array, and the value for 
            that index is the decomposed characters.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 150%"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/malayalam/">&gt;&gt; Use it !</a></p>
          <p style="float: right; width: 260px; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/blog/images/malayalampicker7.png"><img src="r12a_blog_files/malayalampicker7-small.png" alt="Picture of the page in action."></a></p>
          <p>I have just upgraded the Malayalam picker to level 7, and added a 
            bunch of new features that should show up in other pickers at level 7 as
            I get time:</p>
          <p><strong>Shape view</strong> The pickers are aimed particularly at 
            people who are not familiar enough with a script to use the keyboard. 
            However, there are many ligatures and conjuncts in Malayalam, which 
            makes it difficult to identify the character sequences needed.  This 
            view provides most of the shapes you’ll see in Malayalam text, grouped 
            by shape. It’s something I’ve been wanting to add to the pickers for 
            some time.</p>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/blog/images/malayalampicker7-shape.png"><img src="r12a_blog_files/malayalampicker7-shape-small.png" alt="Picture of the page in action."></a></p>
          <p><strong>Phonic view</strong> This has been done in other pickers, but
            it has some new features over those. The sounds have been arranged 
            along similar lines to a standard IPA chart, and multiple transcriptions
            are supported. In addition, you can click on the transcription text to 
            build up a phonemic string in IPA.  This is particularly useful for 
            creating examples.</p>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/blog/images/malayalampicker7-phonic.png"><img src="r12a_blog_files/malayalampicker7-phonic-small.png" alt="Picture of the page in action."></a></p>
          <p><strong>Regular expressions in searches</strong> The search feature 
            was upgraded to allow for regular expressions.  So now you can highlight
            characters containing GA without highlighting ones containing NGA: just
            search for <kbd>\bga\b</kbd> (or use the convenient short-cut form <kbd>.ga.</kbd>).  Of course you can do more complicated searches too.</p>
          <p><strong>Add codepoint</strong> You can add a hex codepoint value to 
            the box in the yellow area to insert into the text.  This is useful for 
            things like the odd unusual character, or for just figuring out what a 
            sequence of codepoints represents. You can input any number of 
            codepoints (including surrogates) into the input box, separating them by
            spaces.</p>
          <p><strong>Chillus</strong> This version of the picker supports all 
            Unicode 5.1 characters, including the chillu characters.  Because most 
            Malayalam fonts support the old way of inputting chillu forms, you can 
            specify in the yellow box area what you want the output to be when 
            clicking on a chillu letter: the pre-5.1 sequence or the new atomic 
            character.  (The default is the atomic character.)</p>
          <p>The picker also comes with the usual set of level 7 features, such as
            font grid view, graphic characters, hiding of uncommon characters, 
            optimised ordering of characters in the alphabetic view, two-tone 
            highlighting, etc.</p>
          <p>You can start up directly in either of the available views by appending the following to your URI: <code>?view=</code>, followed by one of, respectively, <code>alphabet</code>, <code>shape</code>, <code>phonic</code> or <code>fontgrid</code>.</p>
          <p>Enjoy.</p>

          <p>A large amount of code was rewritten to enable data to be downloaded 
            from the server via AJAX at the point of need. This eliminates the long 
            wait when you start to use UniView without the database information in 
            your cache. This means that there is a slightly longer delay when you 
            view a new block, but the code is designed so that if you have already 
            downloaded data, you don’t have to retrieve it again from the server.</p>
          <p>The search mechanism was also rewritten. The regular expressions used
            must now be supported in both JavaScript and PHP (PHP is used if not 
            searching within the current range). When ‘other’ is ticked, the search 
            will look in the alternative name fields, but not in other property 
            settings (so you can no longer use something like ;AL; to search for 
            characters with a particular property. (Use ‘Show list’ instead.))</p>
          <p>Removed several zero-width space characters from the code, which 
            means that UniView now works with Google Chrome, except for some 
            annoying display bugs that I’m not sure how to fix – for example, the 
            first time you try to display any block you only seem to get the top 
            line (although, if you click or drag the mouse, the block is actually 
            there). This seems to be WebKit related, since it happens in Safari, 
            too.</p>
          <p>Please report any bugs to me, and don’t forget to refresh any UniView files in your cache before using the new version.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p style="font-size: 150%;"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/myanmar/">&gt;&gt; Read it !</a></p>
          <p style="float: right; margin: 1px solid teal; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/blog/images/myanmarpicker7.png"><img src="r12a_blog_files/myanmarexcerpt.png" alt="Picture of the page in action."></a></p>
          <p>I finally got to the point, after many long early morning hours, 
            where I felt I could remove the ‘Draft’ from the heading of my Myanmar 
            (Burmese) script notes.</p>
          <p>This page is the result of my explorations into how the Myanmar 
            script is used for the Burmese language in the context of the Unicode 
            Myanmar block. It takes into account the significant changes introduced 
            in Unicode version 5.1 in April of this year.</p>
          <p>Btw, if you have JavaScript running you can get a list of characters 
            in the examples by mousing over them.  If you don’t have JS, you can 
            link to the same information.</p>
          <p>There’s also a <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/myanmar/myanmar.pdf">PDF version</a>, if you don’t want to install the (free) fonts pointed to for the examples.</p>
          <p>Here is a summary of the script:</p>
          <div style="background-color: #F0FFF0; padding: 10px; padding-bottom: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
            <p>Myanmar is a tonal language and is syllable-based. The script is an 
              abugida, ie. consonants carry an inherent vowel sound that is overridden
              using vowel signs.</p>
            <p>Spaces are used to separate phrases, rather than words. Words can be separated with ZWSP to allow for easy wrapping of text.</p>
            <p>Words are composed of syllables. These start with an consonant or 
              initial vowel. An initial consonant may be followed by a medial 
              consonant, which adds the sound j or w. After the vowel, a syllable may 
              end with a nasalisation of the vowel or an unreleased glottal stop, 
              though these final sounds can be represented by various different 
              consonant symbols.</p>
            <p>At the end of a syllable a final consonant usually has an ‘asat’ sign above it, to show that there is no inherent vowel.</p>
            <p>In multisyllabic words derived from an Indian language such as Pali, 
              where two consonants occur internally with no intervening vowel, the 
              consonants tend to be stacked vertically, and the asat sign is not used.</p>
            <p>Text runs from left to right.</p>
            <p>There are a set of Myanmar numerals, which are used just like Latin digits. </p>
          </div>
          <p>So, what next.  I’m quite keen to get to Mongolian.  That looks 
            really complicated. But I’ve been telling myself for a while that I 
            ought to look at Malayalam or Tamil, so I think I’ll try Malayalam.</p>

          <p>I have just upgraded the Burmese picker as follows:</p>
          <p><strong>Rearranged characters</strong> The Myanmar3 font expects 
            multiple combining characters to be entered in the order described in 
            the Unicode 5.1 Standard for correct display.  The panel of combining 
            characters has been arranged so that you can easily remember what that 
            order was.  Characters to the left precede those to the right, 
            characters higher up precede those lower down.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, I have rearranged all the character positions so
            that it is easier to locate the various parts of a syllable as you 
            type.</p>
          <p>I also added some combinations of characters that make up multi-part vowels and the kinzi with a single click.</p>
          <p>I have also moved some of the less common characters to an ‘advanced’
            area to the right which can be opened and closed by clicking on the 
            arrow-head icon.</p>
          <p><strong>New highlighting</strong> As you mouse over a character the 
            picker will show you other characters that are visually similar 
            (particularly useful for those not very familiar with the script). This 
            new version shows the more likely confusable characters with a blue 
            outline, and other similar characters with orange. This is useful given 
            that many Myanmar characters look quite similar.</p>
          <p>As always, you can turn off this feature or disable it in the URI you use to call the picker.</p>
          <p><strong>Font grid view</strong> Shows characters in Unicode order, 
            using whatever font is specified in the Font list or Custom font input 
            fields. This allows comparison of fonts (especially useful in IE, which 
            shows if a glyph is missing from a font). </p>
          <p>You can start up directly in either of the available views by appending the following to your URI: <code>?view=</code>, followed by one of, respectively, <code>alphabet</code> or <code>fontgrid</code>.</p>
          <p>Enjoy.</p>

          <p>Those of you who have used UniView over the last couple of days will 
            have seen that it now supports Unicode 5.1. All Unicode 5.1 character 
            information is available, however you will only be able to see the new 
            characters if you have fonts that cover them.  The decodeunicode 
            graphics for the new characters are not yet available.</p>
          <p>Last night I also fixed a long-running bug that had meant that 
            additional information available in my character database was not 
            accessible in Internet Explorer (due to AJAX issues).   (See the <a href="/blog/?p=149">related post</a> if you are interested in the code).</p>
          <p>There are no other changes at this time (though those two are pretty significant).</p>
          <p>Please report any bugs to me, and don’t forget to refresh any UniView files in your cache before using the new version.</p>

          <p>IE won’t let you import a cloned nodeset into a document, so I wrote this for my <a href="https://r12a.github.io/uniview/">UniView</a> utility. The code starts with a node in the AJAX data and creates a 
            copy of all elements and attributes in the current document.</p>
          <figure class="code">
            <pre>function copyNodes (ajaxnode, copiednode) {

		if (node.nodeType == 1){ //element
			var subnode = document.createElement(node.nodeName);
			var attlist = node.attributes;

        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p style="font-size: 150%"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/lao/">&gt;&gt; Use it !</a></p>
          <p style="float: right; width: 260px; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em"><a href="http://r12a.github.io/blog/images/laopicker.gif"><img src="r12a_blog_files/laopicker-small.gif" alt="Picture of the page in action."></a></p>
          <p>This latest picker includes all characters in the Unicode Lao block, 
            plus a few punctuation characters. There are several alternative views.</p>
          <p><strong>Alphabetic</strong> By default, characters are arranged by 
            groups, and consonants and vowels are listed in alphabetic order. Digits
            are in keypad order. Similar characters are highlighted by default, but
            this can be switched off using the ‘Hint’ selector.</p>
          <p>Tone marks and combining vowels are reordered automatically so that vowels come first in the output character sequence.</p>
          <p><strong>Phonic Characters</strong> are grouped and ordered by sound. I
            set this up for myself to enter Lao text that I wanted to copy that was
            accompanied by a transcription. Initial consonants are followed by 
            tones and consonants that come second in a cluster, then vowels. 
            Alternatives with the same sound are separated by a red dot. Consonants 
            that have different sounds when word final are also listed under those 
            sounds. (Dropped aspiration is not considered significant.) </p>
          <p>Dashes representing consonants indicate which vowels are non-final or
            occur before the consonant. Where a vowel has a part that comes before a
            consonant, a single click should arrange the parts properly. This 
            behaviour speeds up typing. It may not be so intuitive to people 
            familiar with Lao, however, since it makes Lao behave like Khmer and 
            Indic scripts. </p>
          <p>You should add any tone mark before the vowel and the picker will 
            automatically reorder characters as needed. If you want to wrap text 
            around a combination of two syllable-initial characters, type the 
            characters then click on ‘flag as cluster’ before clicking on the tone 
            mark or vowel.</p>
          <p>Two old vowel spellings are only displayed if you click on the grey arrow, top right. </p>
          <p><strong>Font grid</strong> Shows characters in Unicode order, using 
            whatever font is specified in the Font list or Custom font input fields.
            This allows comparison of fonts (especially useful in IE, which shows 
            if a glyph is missing from a font). </p>
          <p>You can start up directly in one of the above views by appending the 
            following to your URI: ?view=, followed by one of, respectively, <code>alphabet</code>, <code>phonic </code>or <code>fontgrid</code>.</p>

          <p>While we await Unicode 5.1, here is another update to UniView that 
            provides a bunch of additional useful features and fixes a few bugs.</p>
          <p>Changes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Changed the custom range input to a single field that will accept 
              various range formats. This makes it easier to cut and paste or drag and
              drop ranges into the input field.  The Custom range field will accept 
              various formats. </li>
            <li>The numbers must be in hexadecimal form and separated by a colon 
              (the default), a hyphen, one or more spaces, or one or more periods. 
              There must be only two numbers. The numbers can be in the following 
              formats: 1234, &amp;#x1234;, &amp;#1234;, \u1234, U+1234. The actual 
              number of hex digits can be between 1 and 6.</li>
            <li>Added the ability to select whether Search looks at any combination 
              of character names only, other parts of a record in the Unicode 
              database, or the other character description information, and added a 
              message to say how many characters were matched.</li>
            <li>Added the ability to search within the range specified in the field entitled Range.</li>
            <li>Added the ability to list characters with a given General or Bidirectional property (within a specified range or not).</li>
            <li>Added an AJAX link to my database of information about Unicode 
              characters. If enabled, using the DB checkbox, this automatically 
              retrieves any available data for a character when information about that
              character is displayed in the lower right panel. You can also specify 
              that UniView should open with that set as the default using <code>database=on</code> in the URI used to call UniView.</li>
            <li>Because of the previous improvement, I removed the ability to link 
              in a file of information about characters. (The information in the files
              was a copy of the information in the database.)</li>
            <li>Moved the Code point(s) and Cut &amp; paste fields lower, to make them easier to use.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that was preventing the Search function finding characters in the Basic Latin block.</li>
            <li>Bugfix: a range like 0036:0067 will always show full rows now; a range with start higher than end will show alert.</li>
            <li>Added reference to decodeunicode when graphics are displayed in left column</li>
            <li>Bugfix: search parameter won’t break when graphics etc toggled</li>
            <li>You can now specify windowHeight parameter at startup in the URI’s query string.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please report any bugs to me, and don’t forget to refresh any UniView files in your cache before using the new version.</p>

            entered by single click. This will probably disconcert people familiar 
            with typing Thai.  Revised description follows.</span></p>
          <p><span style="color:brown">Another update (2008-03-03): I have added 
            additional ways of viewing the characters, and re-architected the picker
            as a basis for extending this to other pickers in the future. I also 
            changed the way of dealing with initial clusters in the phonic view. I 
            changed the text below again to reflect what’s new:</span></p>
          <p><strong>Alphabetic view</strong> By default, characters are arranged 
            by groups, and consonants and vowels are listed in alphabetic order. 
            Digits are in keypad order. Obsolete and rare characters are only 
            displayed if you click on the grey arrow, top right. Similar characters 
            are highlighted by default, but this can be switched off using the 
            ‘Hint’ selector.</p>
          <p><strong>Comparison view</strong> This was the original view for the 
            Thai picker. Characters are grouped by shape or type to enable easy 
            identification by people who are unfamiliar with the Thai script. Vowels
            are shown near the bottom. Digits are on the right, in keypad order.</p>
          <p><strong>Phonic view</strong> Characters are grouped and ordered by 
            sound. I set this up for myself, because I wanted to enter Thai text 
            that was accompanied by a transcription. </p>
          <p>Initial consonants are followed by tones and consonants that come 
            second in a cluster, then vowels. Alternatives with the same sound are 
            separated by a red dot. Consonants that have different sounds when word 
            final are also listed under those sounds. (Dropped aspiration is not 
            considered significant.) </p>
          <p>Dashes representing consonants indicate which vowels are non-final or occur before the consonant. </p>
          <p>Where a vowel has a part that comes before a consonant, a single 
            click should arrange the parts properly. This behaviour speeds up 
            typing. It may not be so intuitive to people familiar with Thai, 
            however, since it makes Thai behave like Khmer and Indic scripts. You 
            should add any tone mark before the vowel and the picker will 
            automatically reorder characters as needed. </p>
          <p>If you want to wrap text around a combination of two syllable-initial
            characters, type the characters then click on ‘flag as cluster’ before 
            clicking on the tone mark or vowel. </p>
          <p><strong>Font grid view</strong> Shows characters in Unicode order, 
            using whatever font is specified in the Font list or Custom font input 
            fields. This allows comparison of fonts (especially useful in IE, which 
            shows if a glyph is missing from a font). </p>
          <p>You can start up directly in any one of the above views by appending the following to your URI: <code>?view=</code>, followed by one of, respectively, <code>alphabet</code>, <code>comparison</code>, <code>phonic</code> or <code>fontgrid</code>.</p>
          <p>Enjoy.</p>

          <p>This latest picker includes characters used for writing Vietnamese. Characters are taken from various Latin Unicode blocks. </p>
          <p>Tones are separated from base characters in the selection area, but 
            the output you create is always fully precomposed. If you copy and paste
            text into the output area, you can normalize the Vietnamese text as NFC
            by selecting the tab below. The Vietnamese text in the output area is 
            also normalized when you select one of the transcription tabs.</p>
          <p>The tabs IPA N and IPA S tabs provide a basic, mostly phonemic-level,
            transcription of the pronunciation. N means North Vietnamese, S is for 
            South. The sources I used for this varied a great deal, particularly in 
            the choice of symbols to represent vowels. There are also more than two 
            main dialects. So this is a synthesis and a rough guide. Some rare vowel
            combinations may be missing, although I have covered quite a number.</p>
          <p>There are a large number of UVN fonts – so many that I didn’t know 
            which ones to pick for the font pulldown. I chose the two that show up 
            on Alan Wood’s page. If you think certain others are so common that they
            ought to be there, please let me know.</p>
          <p>Enjoy.</p>

          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Mon 4 Feb 2008 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=unicode">unicode</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>This post is about the dangers of tying a specification, protocol or application to a specific version of Unicode. </p>
          <p>For example, I was in a discussion last week about XML, and the 
            problems caused by the fact that XML 1.0 is currently tied to a specific
            version of Unicode, and a very old version at that (2.0). This affects 
            what characters you can use for things such as element and attribute 
            names, enumerated lists for attribute values, and ids. Note that I’m <em>not</em> talking about the content, just those names. </p>
          <p>I <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/03/02-ishida-tech-plen/">spoke about this</a> at a W3C Technical Plenary some time back in terms of how this bars   
            people from using certain aspects of XML applications in their own 
            language if they use scripts that have been added to Unicode since 
            version 2.0. This includes over 150 million people speaking languages 
            written with Ethiopic, Canadian Syllabics, Khmer, Sinhala, Mongolian, 
            Yi, Philippine, New  Tai Lue, Buginese, Cherokee, Syloti Nagri, N’Ko,  
            Tifinagh and other scripts.</p>
          <p>This means, for example, that if your language is written with one of
            these scripts, and you write some XHTML that you want to be valid (so 
            you can use it with AJAX or XSLT, etc.), you can’t use the same language
            for an <a href="#%E1%8A%A2%E1%88%BA%E1%8B%B3" name="ኢሺዳ" id="ኢሺዳ">id attribute value</a> as for the content of your page. (Try <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&amp;uri=http%3A%2F%2Fr12a.github.io%2Fblog%2F">validating this page</a> now. The previous link used some Ethiopic for the name and id attribute values.) </p>
          <p><strong>But there’s another issue</strong> that hasn’t received so 
            much press – and yet I think, in it’s own way, it can be just as 
            problematic. Scripts that were supported by Unicode 2.0 have not stood 
            still, and additional characters are being added to such scripts with 
            every new Unicode release. In some cases these characters will see very 
            general use. Take for example,  the Bengali character U+09CE BENGALI 
            LETTER KHANDA TA.</p>
          <p>With the release of Unicode 4.1 this character was added to the 
            standard, with a clear admonition that it should in future be used in 
            text, rather than the workaround people had been using previously.</p>
          <p>This is not a rarely used character. It is a common part of the alphabet. Put Bengali <a href="#%E0%A6%89%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%B9" name="উতসহ" id="উতসহ">in a link</a> and you’re generally ok. Include <a href="#%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%81%E0%A7%8E%E0%A6%B8%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%A4" name="কুৎসিত" id="কুৎসিত">a khanda ta letter</a> in it, though, and you’re in trouble. It’s as if English speakers could
            use any word in an id, as long as it didn’t have a ‘q’ in it. It’s a 
            recipe for confusion and frustration.</p>
          <p>Similar, but much more far reaching, changes will be introduced to 
            the Myanmar script (used for Burmese) in the upcoming version 5.1. 
            Unlike the khanda ta, these changes will affect almost every word. So if
            your application or protocol froze its Unicode support to a version 
            between 3.0 and 5.0, like IDNA, you will suddenly be disenfranchising 
            Burmese users who had been perfectly happy until now.</p>
          <p>Here are a few more examples (provided by Ken Whistler) of characters
            added to Unicode after the initial script adoption that will raise 
            eyebrows for people who speak the relevant language: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>01F6 LATIN SMALL LETTER N WITH GRAVE: shows up in NFC pinyin data for Chinese.</li>
            <li>0219 LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH COMMA BELOW:  Romanian data.</li>
            <li>0450 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER IE WITH GRAVE: Macedonian in  NFC.</li>
            <li>0653..0655 Arabic combining maddah and hamza:  Implicated in  NFC normalization of common Arabic letters now.</li>
            <li>0972 DEVANAGARI LETTER CANDRA A: Marathi.</li>
            <li>097B DEVANAGARI LETTER GGA: Sindhi.</li>
            <li>0B35 ORIYA LETTER VA:  Oriya.</li>
            <li>0BB6 TAMIL LETTER SHA:  Needed to  spell sri.</li>
            <li>0D7A..0D7F   Malayalam chillu letters:  Those will be  ubiquitous in Malayalam data, post Unicode 5.1.</li>
            <li>and a bunch of Chinese additions. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>So the moral is this: decouple your application, protocol or 
            specification from a specific version of the Unicode Standard. Allow new
            characters to be used by people as they come along, and users all 
            around the world will thank you.</p>

          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Thu 31 Jan 2008 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>This came up again recently in a discussion on the W3C <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/">i18n Interest Group list</a>, and I decided to put my thoughts in this post so that I can point people to them easily.</p>
          <p>I think HTML4 and HTML5 should continue to support &lt;b&gt; and 
            &lt;i&gt; tags, for backwards compatability, but we should urge caution 
            regarding their use and strongly encourage people to use &lt;em&gt; and 
            &lt;strong&gt; or elements with class="…"  where appropriate. (I 
            reworded this 2008-02-01)</p>
          <p>Here are a couple of reasons I say that:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>I constantly see people misusing these tags in ways that can make localization of content difficult.</p>
              <p>For example, just because and English document may use italicisation 
                for emphasis, document titles and foreign words, it doesn’t hold that a 
                Japanese translation of the document will use a single presentational 
                convention for all three. Japanese authors may avoid both italicization 
                and bolding, since their characters are too complicated to look good in 
                small sizes with these effects. Japanese translators may find that the 
                content communicates better if they use <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/css3-text/#Slide0200">wakiten (boten marks)</a> for emphasis, but corner brackets for 『&nbsp;document names&nbsp;』, and
                guillemets for 《&nbsp;foreign words&nbsp;》. These are common Japanese 
                typographic approaches that we don’t use in English. </p>
              <p>The problem is that, if the English author has used &lt;i&gt; tags 
                everywhere (thinking about the presentational rendering he/she wants in 
                English), the Japanese localizer will be unable to easily apply 
                different styling to the different types of text.</p>
              <p>The problem  could be avoided if semantic markup is used. If the English author had used <code>&lt;em&gt;..&lt;/em&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span class="doctitle"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span class="foreignword"&gt;..&lt;/span&gt;</code> to distinguish the three cases, it would allow the localizer to easily 
                change the CSS to achieve different effects for these items, one at a 
                time.</p>
              <p>Of course, over time this is equally relevant to pages that are 
                monolingual. Suppose your new corporate publishing guidelines change, 
                and proclaim that bolding is better than italics for document names. 
                With semantically marked up HTML, you can easily change a whole site 
                with one tiny edit to the CSS. In the situation described above, 
                however, you’d have to hunt through every page for relevant &lt;i&gt; 
                tags and change them individually, so that you didn’t apply the same 
                style change to emphasis and foreign words too. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Allowing authors to use &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; tags is also 
                problematic, in my mind, because it keeps authors thinking in 
                presentational terms, rather than helping them move to properly semantic
                markup. At the very least, it blurs the ideas. To an author in a hurry,
                it is also tempting to just slap one of these tags on the text to make 
                it look different, rather than to stop and think about things like 
                consistency and future-proofing. (Yes, I’ve often done it too…)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I always forget how to get around the namespace issue when 
            transforming XHTML files to XHTML using XSL, and it always takes ages 
            for me to figure it out again.  So I’m going to make a note here to 
            remind me. This seems to work:</p>
          <p><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</code></p>
          <p><code>&lt;xsl:transform version="2.0"<br>
            xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"<br>
            xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" 
            xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" 
            xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" 
            xmlns:fn="http://www.w3.org/2005/02/xpath-functions" 
            xmlns:xdt="http://www.w3.org/2005/02/xpath-datatypes"<br>
            xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon"<br>
            &lt;strong&gt;exclude-result-prefixes="saxon fn xs xdt html"&lt;/strong&gt;&gt;</code>;</p>
          <p><code>&lt;xsl:output method="xhtml" encoding="UTF-8"<br>
            doctype-public="-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" indent="no" 
            doctype-system="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"
            /&gt;</code></p>
          <p>Then you need to refer to elements in the source to be converted by 
            using the html: namespace prefix, eg. &lt;xsl :template 
            match=”html:div”&gt;….&lt;/xsl&gt;.</p>
          <p>I always have to look up the template that copies everything not 
            fiddled with in the other templates, too, so here it is, for good 
            measure:</p>
          <pre>&lt;xsl:template match="@*|node()"&gt;
	&lt;xsl:copy&gt;
		&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/&gt;

          <p>Although I have a picker already for Arabic, Persian and Urdu, I have
            developed another that is specifically for inputting Urdu.  One reason 
            for this is to reduce the choice of characters so that the user is more 
            likely to select the right character for Urdu (eg. heh goal rather than 
            arabic heh). Another is to provide shortcuts for things like aspirated 
            letters and some common combinations (like the word ‘allah’).</p>
          <p>It includes characters used for Urdu in Unicode 5.0. Most of the characters in the Urdu standard UZT 1.01 are included.</p>
          <p>The aspirated letters of the alphabet can be entered with a single 
            click. Also, base characters with diacritics can be inserted into the 
            text with a single click where NFC normalisation would produce a single 
            precomposed character. </p>
          <p>Letters of the alphabet are shown in alphabetic order at the top 
            left, digits are in keypad order, and combining characters related to 
            vowel sounds are shown along the bottom. The lower middle section 
            contains useful but non-alphabetic characters and punctuation. To the 
            right are various symbols. Hinting is implemented for visually similar 
            glyphs.</p>

          <p>Pickers allow you to quickly create phrases in a script by clicking 
            on Unicode characters arranged in a way that aids their identification. 
            Pickers are likely to be most useful if you don’t know a script well 
            enough to use the native keyboard. The arrangement of characters also 
            makes it much more useable than a regular character map utility.</p>
          <p>The Bengali picker includes all the characters in the Unicode 5.0 
            Bengali block. Note: There was an important addition to the Bengali 
            block in version 4.1, a single character for khanda ta, that may not yet
            be supported in fonts, but has been added to this version of the 
            picker.</p>
          <p>Consonants are mostly in a typical articulatory arrangement, vowels 
            are aligned with vowel signs, and digits are in keypad order. Hinting is
            implemented for visually similar glyphs.</p>
          <p>A function has also been added to transliterate Bengali text to 
            Latin, though the scheme used is not standard, and may change at short 
            notice.  Don’t use it in anger yet.</p>
