          <h2 class="post-title">Tibetan emphasis</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Mon 9 Jul 2007 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=layout">layout</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <div class="floatright"><a href="http://r12a.github.io/blog/images/tibetan-emphasis.gif"><img src="r12a_blog_files/tibetan-emphasis.gif" alt="Picture of Tibetan emphasis."></a></div>
          <p>Christopher Fynn of the National Library of Bhutan raised an 
            interesting question on the W3C Style and I18n lists.  Tibetan emphasis 
            is often achieved using one of two small marks below a Tibetan syllable,
            a little like Japanese <a href="http://r12a.github.io/scripts/tutorial/slides/Slide1400.html">wakiten</a>.  The picture shows <a href="http://r12a.github.io/uniview/?char=0F35&amp;utf8=false">U+0F35: TIBETAN MARK NGAS BZUNG NYI ZLA</a> in use.  The other form is <a href="http://r12a.github.io/uniview/?char=0F37&amp;utf8=false">0F37: TIBETAN MARK NGAS BZUNG SGOR RTAGS</a>.</p>
          <p>Chris was arguing that using CSS, rather than Unicode characters, to render these marks could be useful because:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the mark applies to, and is centred below a whole ‚Äòsyllable‚Äô ‚Äì not 
              just the stack of the syllable ‚Äì this may be easier to achieve with 
              styling than font positioning where, say, a syllable has an even number 
              of head characters (see examples to the far right in the picture)</li>
            <li>it would make it easier to search for text if these characters were not interspersed in it</li>
            <li>it would allow for flexibility in approaches to the visual style 
              used for emphasis ‚Äì you would be able to change between using these 
              marks or alternatives such as use of red colour or changes in font size 
              just by changing the CSS style sheet (as we can for English text).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are of potential issues with this approach too.  These include 
            things like the fact that the horizontal centring of glyphs within the 
            syllable is not trivial. The vertical placement is also particularly 
            difficult.  You will notice from the attached image that the height 
            depends on the depth of the text it falls below.  On the other hand, it 
            isn‚Äôt easy to achieve this with diacritics either, given the number of 
            possible permutations of characters in a syllable.  Such positioning is 
            much more complicated than that of the Japanese wakiten.</p>
          <p>A bigger issue may turn out to be that the application for this is 
            fairly limited, and user agent developers have other priorities ‚Äì at 
            least for commercial applications.</p>
          <p>To follow along with, and perhaps contribute to, the discussion follow the thread on the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2007Jun/0158.html">style list</a> or the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/2007AprJun/0208.html">www-international list</a>.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p><strong>UPDATE: This post has now been updated, reviewed and released as a W3C article. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names">http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names</a>.</strong></p>
          <p>People who create web forms, databases, or ontologies in 
            English-speaking countries are often unaware how different people‚Äôs 
            names can be in other countries. They build their forms or databases in a
            way that assumes too much on the part of foreign users.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôm going to explore some of the potential issues in a series of blog
            posts.  This content will probably go through a number of changes 
            before settling down to something like a final form.  Consider it more 
            like a set of wiki pages than a typical blog post.</p>
          <h3>Scenarios</h3>
          <div style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><img src="r12a_blog_files/name-full.gif" alt="A form that asks for your name in a single field."><br>
            <img style="margin-bottom: 1em;" src="r12a_blog_files/name-first-last.gif" alt="A form that asks for separate first and last names."> </div>
          <p>It seems to me that there are a couple of key scenarios to consider.</p>
          <p><strong style="font-size: 140%;">A</strong> You are designing a form in a single language (let‚Äôs assume English) that people from around the world will be filling in.</p>
          <p><strong style="font-size: 140%;">B</strong> You are designing a form 
            in a one language but the form will be adapted to suit the cultural 
            differences of a given locale when the site is translated.</p>
          <p>In reality, you will probably not be able to localise for every 
            different culture, so even if you rely on approach B, some people will 
            still use a form that is not intended specifically for their culture.</p>
          <h3>Examples of differences</h3>
          <p>To get started, let‚Äôs look at some examples of how people‚Äôs names are different around the world.</p>
          <h4>Given name and patronymic</h4>
          <p>In the name <strong>Bj√∂rk Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir</strong> Bj√∂rk is the given 
            name. The second part of the name indicates the father‚Äôs (or sometimes 
            the mother‚Äôs) name, followed by -sson for a male and -sd√≥ttir for a 
            female, and is more of a description than a family name in the Western 
            sense. Bj√∂rk‚Äôs father, Gu√∞mundor, was the son of Gunnar, so is known as 
            Gu√∞mundur Gunnarsson. </p>
          <p>Icelanders prefer to be called by their given name (Bj√∂rk), or by 
            their full name (Bj√∂rk Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir).  Bj√∂rk wouldn‚Äôt normally expect 
            to be called Ms. Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir.  Telephone directories in Iceland are 
            sorted by given name.</p>
          <p>Other cultures where a person has one given name followed by a 
            patronymic include parts of Southern India, Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
          <h4>Different order of parts</h4>
          <p>In the name <strong>ÊØõÊ≥Ω‰∏ú</strong> [mao ze dong] the family name is 
            Mao, ie. the first name, left to right. The given name is Dong.  The 
            middle character, Ze, is a generational name, and is common to all his 
            siblings (such as his brothers and sister, ÊØõÊ≥ΩÊ∞ë [mao ze min],  ÊØõÊ≥ΩË¶É [mao 
            ze tan], and ÊØõÊæ§Á¥Ö [mao ze hong]).</p>
          <p>Among acquaintances Mao may be referred to as ÊØõÊ≥Ω‰∏úÂÖàÁîü [mao ze dong xiƒÅn
            shƒìng] or ÊØõÂÖàÁîü [mao xiƒÅn shƒìng].  Not everyone uses generational names 
            these days, especially in Mainland China.  If you are on familiar terms 
            with someone called ÊØõÊ≥Ω‰∏ú, you would normally refer to them using Ê≥Ω‰∏ú [ze 
            dong], not just ‰∏ú [dong].</p>
          <p>Note also that the names are not separated by spaces.</p>
          <p>The order family name followed by given name(s) is common in other countries, such as Japan, Korea and Hungary. </p>
          <p>Chinese people who deal with Westerners will often adopt an 
            additional given name that is easier for Westerners to use.  For 
            example, Yao Ming (family name Yao, given name Ming) may write his name 
            for foreigners as Fred Yao Ming or Fred Ming Yao. </p>
          <h4>Multiple family names</h4>
          <p>Spanish-speaking people will commonly have two family names.  For example, <strong>Maria-Jose Carre√±o Qui√±ones</strong> may be the daughter of Antonio Carre√±o Rodr√≠guez and Mar√≠a Qui√±ones Marqu√©s.</p>
          <p>You would refer to her as Se√±orita Carre√±o, not Se√±orita Qui√±ones.</p>
          <h4>Variant forms</h4>
          <p>We already saw that the patronymic in Iceland ends in -son or 
            -d√≥ttir, depending on whether the child is male or female.  Russians use
            patronymics as their middle name but also use family names, in the 
            order given-patronymic-family.  The endings of the patronymic and family
            names will indicate whether the person in question is male or female.  
            For example, the wife of <strong>–ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞ÃÅ–µ–≤–∏—á –ï–ª—å—Ü–∏–Ω</strong> (Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin) is <strong>–ù–∞–∏–Ω–∞ –ò–æ—Å–∏—Ñ–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –ï–ª—å—Ü–∏–Ω–∞</strong> (Naina Iosifovna Yeltsina) ‚Äì note how the husband‚Äôs names end in 
            consosonants, while the wife‚Äôs names (even the patronymic from her 
            father) end in a.</p>
          <h4>Mixing it up</h4>
          <p>Many cultures mix and match these differences from Western personal names, and add their own novelties. </p>
          <p>For example, <strong>Velikkakathu Sankaran Achuthanandan </strong>is a
            Kerala name from Southern India, usually written V. S. Achuthanandan 
            which follows the order familyName-fathersName-givenName.  In many parts
            of the world, parts of names are derived from titles, locations, 
            genealogical information, caste, religious references, and so on, eg. 
            the Arabic <strong>Abu Karim Muhammad al-Jamil ibn Nidal ibn Abdulaziz al-Filistini</strong>.</p>
          <p>In Vietnam, names such as <strong>Nguy·ªÖn T·∫•n D≈©ng</strong> follow the
            order family-middle-given name.  Although this seems similar to the 
            Chinese example above, even in a formal situation this Prime Minister of
            Vietnam is referred to using his <em>given name</em>, ie. Mr. Dung, not Mr. Nguyen. </p>
          <h4>Further reading</h4>
          <p>Wikipedia sports a large number of fascinating articles about how 
            people‚Äôs names look in various cultures around the world.  I strongly 
            recommend a perusal of the follow links.</p>

          <h3>Consequences</h3>
          <p>If designing a form or database that will accept names from people with a variety of backgrounds, you should <strong>ask yourself whether you really need to have separate fields for given name and family name</strong>.</p>
          <p>This will depend on what you need to do with the data, but obviously 
            it will be simpler to just use the full name as the user provides it, 
            where possible.</p>
          <p>Note that if you have separate fields because you want to use the 
            person‚Äôs given name to communicate with them, you may not only have 
            problems due to name syntax, but there are varying expectations around 
            the world with regards to formality also that need to be accounted for. 
            It may be better to <strong>ask separately, when setting up a profile for example, how that person would like you to address them</strong>.</p>
          <p>If you do still feel you need to ask for constituent parts of a name separately, <strong>try to avoid using the labels ‚Äòfirst name‚Äô and ‚Äòlast name‚Äô</strong>, since these can be confusing for people who normally write their family name followed by given names.</p>
          <p><strong>Be careful, also, about assumptions built into algorithms that pull out the parts of a name automatically</strong>.  For example, the v-card and h-card approach of <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard#Implied_.22n.22_Optimization">implied ‚Äún‚Äù optimization</a> could have difficulties with, say, Chinese names.  You should <strong>be as clear as possible about telling people how to specify their name</strong> so that you capture the data you think you need.</p>
          <p>If you are designing forms that will be localised on a per culture 
            basis, don‚Äôt forget that atomised name parts may still need to be stored
            in a central database, which therefore needs to be able to represent 
            all the various complexities that you dealt with by relegating the form 
            design to the localisation effort.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôll post some further issues and thoughts about personal names when time allows.</p>

          <p>This morning I came across an interesting <a href="http://www.tomski.com/archive/new_archive/000063.html">set of principles</a> for site design. It was developed as part of the BBC 2.0 project.</p>
          <p>That led me to the BBC Director General‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/thompson_baird.shtml">BBC 2.0: why on demand changes everything</a>‚Äú.  Also a very interesting read as a case study for the web as part of a medium of mass communication.</p>
          <p>One particular topic out of several I found of interest:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Interestingly, on July 7th last year, which was by far 
              the biggest day yet for the use of rich audio-visual content from our 
              news site, the content most frequently demanded was the eyewitness user 
              generated content (UGC) from the bomb scenes.</p>
            <p>Shaky, blurry images uploaded by one member of the public, downloaded by hundreds of thousands of other members of the public.</p>
            <p>It‚Äôs a harbinger of a very different, more collaborative, more involving kind of news.</p>
            <p>Here, as at so many other points in the digital revolution, the 
              public are moving very quickly now ‚Äì at least as quickly as the 
              broadcasters.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>I also find it interesting to see how news spreads through channels 
            like Flickr.  Eighteen months ago we were mysteriously bounced out of 
            bed at 6am, but there was nothing on the TV to explain what had 
            happened.  I went up to the roof patio and took some of the first photos
            of the Buncefield explosion, including a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ishida/72300907/">photo</a> taken just 20 minutes after the blast, and uploaded it to Flickr. A slightly <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ishida/72309076/">later photo</a> hit the number one spot for interestingness for that day. And as many <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/groups/?q=buncefield&amp;m=pool&amp;s=rec&amp;w=71603202%40N00&amp;page=24">other people‚Äôs</a> photos appeared it was possible to get a lot of information, even ahead
            of the national news, including eye witness accounts, about what had 
            happened.</p>

          <p>One difference you‚Äôll notice, if you switch to a language other than English, is that the icons above a photo <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ishida/538921480/">such as on this page</a> have no text in them.</p>
          <p>I checked with Flickr staff, and they confirmed that this is because 
            of the difficulty of squeezing in the translated text in the space 
            available.  A classic localization issue, and one that developers and 
            designers should always consider when designing the UI.</p>
          <p>For example, here‚Äôs the relevant part of the English UI:</p>
          <p><img src="r12a_blog_files/seals-english.jpg" alt="Picture of the English version, with text embedded in graphics."></p>
          <p>and here is what it looks like when using the Spanish (or indeed any other) UI:</p>
          <p><img src="r12a_blog_files/seals-spanish.jpg" alt="Picture of the Spanish version with only icons, no text."></p>
          <p>The text has been dropped in favour of just icons. Note, however, how
            the text appears in the tooltips that pop up as you mouse over the 
            icons.</p>
          <p>This can be an effective way of addressing the problems of text expansion during translation, as long as the icons are <span style="text-decoration: line-through">understandable</span> memorable and free from cultural bias or offense.  Using the tooltips 
            to clarify the meaning is useful too.  I think these icons work well, 
            and I‚Äôd actually like the Flickr folks to make the English version look 
            like this, too.  It detracts less from the photos, to my mind.</p>
          <p>Here‚Äôs what it may have looked like if Flickr had done the Portuguese in the same way as the English:</p>
          <p><img src="r12a_blog_files/seals-portuguese.jpg" alt="Picture of a hypothetical Portuguese version with text in the graphics."></p>
          <p>There are a number of problems here.  The text is quite dense, it 
            overshoots the width of the photo (there are actually still two letters 
            missing on the right), and it is quite hard to see the accented 
            characters.  The text would have to be in a much bigger font to support 
            the complexity of the characters in Chinese and Korean (and of course 
            many other future languages).</p>
          <p>Of course, in many situations where text appears in graphics the 
            available width for the text is seriously fixed, and usually within a 
            space that just about fits the English (if that‚Äôs the source).</p>
          <p>Text will usually expand when translating from English, in 
            particular.  This expansion can be particularly pronounced for short 
            pieces of text like icon labels.</p>
          <p>So the moral of this story: Think several times before using text in 
            graphics, and in particular icons.  If you need to localise your page 
            later, you could have problems.  Better just avoid it from the start if 
            you can.</p>

	<p>Updated, 5 September 2014</p>
<p>There‚Äôs one piece of music I like so much I‚Äôd like it played at my 
funeral.  I‚Äôve not had an opportunity to tell anyone that yet, but this 
seems as good a time as any.  </p>
<p>It‚Äôs a piece of music I listen to regularly, and never get tired of.  </p>
<p>In the days when I did lots of acting, I would always lie down and 
try to completely relax immediately before my first entry onto the stage
 as Figaro, Iago, Pauvre Bitos, Biedermann, Trissotin, Ariel ‚Äì whatever 
role.  You‚Äôd find me lying in some quiet, dark corner with my headphones
 on, and always listening to this piece of music.  </p>
<p>It is calming but rich, it‚Äôs exotic but deep, it mingles melody with 
tone poem.  It would wake up my sensitivity to culture and feeling, and 
still does, while helping me wash away the worries and concerns of the 
day. </p>
<p>Ok, so you want to know what it is?  Alright.  It‚Äôs one of pieces in 
the Trittico Boticelliano (Three Boticelli Pictures) by Respighi.  
Specifically, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Respighi-Trittico-Botticelliano-LAdorazione-Magi/dp/B003RXKNTK/ref=sr_1_2?s=dmusic&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409904813&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=Adorazione+dei+Magi+heltay">L‚ÄôAdorazione dei Magi</a> (The Adoration of the Magi). I usually listen to the version by Laszlo Heltay, on the album Essential Respighi.</p>
<p>My second favourite piece is the version of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gloire-p%C3%A8re-Ch%C3%A2teau-suite-dorchestre/dp/B0025YYBY0/ref=sr_1_4?s=dmusic&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409905062&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=valse+d%27augustine">La Valse d‚ÄôAugustine</a>,
 from the soundtrack of Le Ch√¢teau de ma M√®re, that is part of Vladimir 
Cosma‚Äôs Suites Symphoniques. My appreciation of this music is greatly 
enhanced by memory of the ending of Yves Robert‚Äôs film, which is perfect
 down to the very last word (in French).</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

	<h2 class="post-title"><a href="/blog/?p=91" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Using slides for presentations">Using slides for presentations</a></h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Mon 16 Apr 2007 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>I was just pointed to an article entitled ‚Äú<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/04/16/death_by_powerpoint/">Missing the PowerPoint of public speaking</a>‚Äù by Guy Kewney (the URI ends with ‚Äòdeath_by_powerpoint‚Äô).</p>
<p>I‚Äôm sorry, but I thought that was a fairly lame article. </p>
<p>First out, it is not about PowerPoint, but about the use of slides.  
And you could very easily replace ‚ÄòPowerPoint‚Äô with ‚ÄòSlidy‚Äô [an 
XHTML-based slide presentation tool used at the W3C] throughout the 
article.</p>
<p>Next, the author seems to assume that ‚Äòvisual notes‚Äô have to be 
written sentences of text. In his conclusion he says that his 
‚Äòfundamental assumption‚Äô is </p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúIf you engage the audience, get them to respond in some 
way, you‚Äôll hold their attention and get good feedback. I don‚Äôt know how
 you‚Äôd set up a PowerPoint show that would allow that flexibility.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>While I‚Äôll concede that a very large proportion of speakers do 
plaster their slides with text, it‚Äôs not inevitable.  I try to use 
slides mostly to show pictures or illustrations, which I then talk about
 and point at, but document elsewhere in notes. (See for example my 
presentation ‚Äú<a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/Talks/fundamentos-web-ri/slides/Slide0010.html">Practical &amp; Cultural Issues in Designing International Web Sites‚Äù</a>). I find slides, <em>when used that way</em>,
 a very powerful tool to assist communication.  A picture conveys more 
than words, and facilitates understanding.  I also find the examples 
used to be particularly effective in helping a listener remember things 
that were said ‚Äì particularly when they come across a similar example in
 their work.</p>
<p>You can also use slides to graphically help the user understand where
 they are in the discussion and what the current topic is. That can be a
 significant help in keeping people on board or guiding them towards 
your conclusion (and even keeping the attention of people who know about
 the topic addressed by part of the talk by showing them how that fits 
in with other stuff you will say that perhaps they didn‚Äôt know, etc.)</p>
<p>Slides can also help you in structuring your discussion, bringing it 
in on time, and summarising key points.  Of course, they have to be 
designed with care and used properly to do that.  </p>
<p>I‚Äôve seen plenty of people in conferences get a third of the way 
through their slides and realise that they have run out of time.  What‚Äôs
 bad there is that people are just spewing out poorly designed slide 
content, and then not, as the author says, engaging with the audience.  </p>
<p>But done right, creating a slide presentation can really help 
structure (and importantly weed out, compact and bring down to an 
appropriate size) your thoughts, even if you don‚Äôt plan to project the 
slides.  If you have 50 text-heavy slides for a 20 minute presentation, 
you can see, if you look, that it might be difficult to fit all your 
points in the allotted time.  Because slides tend to make you think of a
 presentation in terms of components, however, you are also often likely
 to be able to see easily where slides (and therefore information) can 
be pruned to fit the allotted time while still getting over the message.
 </p>
<p>For what it‚Äôs worth, in my mind, the critical part of creating an 
effective presentation is always the process of deciding what to now 
leave out, after you‚Äôve decided what to put in. I usually start with my 
intended conclusion/effect, then decide what are the major points I need
 to make to get to that conclusion, and then use my time constaints and 
knowledge about the audience to decide how many points I need and how 
long I have to make each point. The argument is often more important 
than the data. You can‚Äôt be persuasive if you disrespect your audience.</p>
<p>By the way, if I do have a page with bullets on, I try to always use 
builds.  This keeps the user focused on what you are currently saying, 
reduces the stress of them trying to match text with speech, and avoids 
them reading ahead to stuff that needs their attention during the 
earlier points if it is to be properly understood.</p>
<p>PowerPoint, by the way, is a very handy tool for creating and 
organizing the types of slide I like to make. Note however that I try to
 prepare slide notes or articles for people to rediscover the 
information later, and make them and the slides available in a portable 
format such as valid XHTML with CSS, or PDF</p>
<p>Having said that, I suppose it also comes down to individual speaking
 styles.  I can think of many occasions when I sat in conferences 
listening to a poor speaker and thanked my lucky stars that they had 
committed the main ideas in succinct and well-organized form to their 
slides, because it helped me understand what they were actually trying 
to say.</p>
<p>Another thought about the article.  Guy says </p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThere are indeed a few situations ‚Äì of the ‚Äòblackboard 
notes‚Äô lecture type ‚Äì where PowerPoint is actually useful ‚Äì where you 
want to have your audience stop and write down what you‚Äôre saying.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>I can‚Äôt think of any such occasions.  Memories come back to me of one
 lecturer at Cambridge (and others elsewhere) who would spend lesson 
after lesson writing notes on speech synthesis on the blackboard, which 
we then copied to our notebooks. It seemed then, and seems now, like a 
monumental waste of time.  I‚Äôd much rather have a copy of the notes 
given to me.  Apart from it sparing my aching wrist, I could have 
digested the content that way in a fraction of the time.  </p>
<p>The value of being in the presence of the person conveying the 
knowledge is the time that it makes available for presenter to bring the
 topic to life by their presentation style (including possibly unwritten
 humour or memorable anecdotes), and the opportunity for the audience to
 ask and debate questions.  If I knew in advance that someone at a 
conference was going to just repeat their paper or slides verbatim, I‚Äôd 
much rather spend my time in another track.</p>
<p>Another thought, unrelated to Guy‚Äôs article. Many of the 
Takahashi-style presentations I‚Äôve seen don‚Äôt always impress me. It‚Äôs 
good to get the user away from writing long sentences on the slides.  
And a single large word on a page can have a strong impact temporarily. 
 But after a few slides like that, the impact begins to be lost, I begin
 to find myself less able to distinguish words that need to convey 
impact from those that are just fillers, and I too become lost, in terms
 of where we are in the presentation.  I think it is more useful to 
diagrammatically help the user see (useful) <em>relationships</em> 
between concepts rather than just flash them up in serial fashion. Like a
 site map, showing how ideas interconnect can help your listener better 
assimilate the relationships between the ideas you are putting before 
them.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">New web app: Searching for language subtags</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Sun 1 Apr 2007 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=apps">apps</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=langtags">langtags</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p style="font-size: 150%"><a href="http://r12a.github.io/utils/subtags/">&gt;&gt; Use it !</a></p>
          <div style="float: right; width: 260px; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="http://r12a.github.io/blog/images/subtag-search.gif"><img src="r12a_blog_files/subtag-search-small.gif" alt="Picture of the page in action."></a></div>
          <p>This tool allows you to search for subtags that have, say, ‚Äòfrench‚Äô in their description <a href="http://r12a.github.io/utils/subtags/index.php?searchtext=french&amp;searchtype=2&amp;submit=Show+result">(there are currently 11)</a>, or to find out what that mysterious ‚Äòch‚Äô subtag stands for <a href="http://r12a.github.io/utils/subtags/index.php?searchtext=ch&amp;searchtype=1&amp;submit=Show+result">(there are 2 possibilities)</a>. </p>
          <p><strong>Update:</strong> You can now also search for a hyphen-separated sequences of subtags, such as <a href="http://r12a.github.io/utils/subtags/index.php?searchtext=sl-IT-nedis&amp;searchtype=1">sl-IT-nedis</a> and find out what each of the component subtags mean.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, you can simply list all current language tags, or script tags, or variants, etc.</p>
          <p>For months I‚Äôve been wanting to write a small, Web-based tool for 
            finding things in the subtag registry without having to work on the (for
            many people, intimidating) raw text file on the IANA site.</p>
          <p><a href="http://and-other-things.blogspot.com/2007/03/going-multilinugal-where-to-get-your.html">Tom Gruner</a> created an initial tool for pretty printing the IANA list, which 
            handled enough of the basics to allow me to use the little time I have 
            these days to add the search functionality on top.</p>
          <p>If you have JavaScript running, you are shown just the tags and 
            descriptions initially, but by clicking on those you can reveal all 
            additional information in the registry for a given tag.  I also 
            highlight tags that are deprecated, so you can see that straight away.</p>
          <p>(PS: Some final tweaks to the code will come when I have a spare 
            moment for things like making the expanding list more accessible, etc.)</p>

            hiding and revealing information on a page that you should be able to 
            plug in to a wide range of content. Please feel free to use the code 
            (though an acknowledgement would be nice.)</p>
          <div style="background-color: #993300; color: white; padding: 0.5em;"><strong>Files</strong> </div>
          <div style="border: 1px solid #993300; padding: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 1em;"> JavaScript: <a href="http://r12a.github.io/code/expandcollapse/expandcollapse.js">expandcollapse.js</a>

            <p></p>
            <p><em>The uncollapsed text. (Click to see larger version.)</em></p>
          </div>
          <p>We‚Äôll illustrate how to apply this with an example.  The picture shows what it looks like initially. (<a href="http://r12a.github.io/code/expandcollapse/news.html">View the HTML</a>.)
            We‚Äôll collapse the additional news after the first item to just the 
            headlines, but allow you to reveal the detail by clicking or tabbing and
            hitting return.</p>
          <p>[I applied this to a hacked down version of someone else‚Äôs page, 
            because I was short on time.   This is good, in that it shows that it‚Äôs 
            easy to apply this to existing pages.  However, due to my hacking, the 
            general markup of the page may look a little strange in parts.  Please 
            ignore that.]</p>
          <h3>Structuring the content</h3>
          <p>The markup of content you want to hide and reveal may be structured in a number of ways. This approach assumes that:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>you will click on a block element (which we will call the trigger) to cause some  content below it to expand or contract</li>
            <li>the content revealed/hidden by clicking on the trigger can be in any
              number of block elements of any type. (You can also include other block
              elements above the trigger, if you like, though they won‚Äôt be hidden.)</li>
            <li>each trigger and its revealable content is bounded by a block element. (We will use a div, but it could be any block element.)</li>
            <li>all the expanding and collapsing content is surrounded by another 
              element with an id.  This allows you to work with expanding content in 
              different areas on the same page separately. (Again we use a div, with 
              the id <code>otherNews</code>, but the id could just as easily be on the body element, since we only have one area of affected content on this page.)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The diagram below shows the arrangement used in the example file. The
            trigger element is red.  The content to be hidden/revealed is green. 
            You don‚Äôt have to use an h3 as the trigger.  You could even use an 
            ordinary paragraph tag.  If you do, however, you should use a class name
            on each trigger element, so that the trigger can be identified.</p>
          <p>Note that the trigger element should not contain an &lt;a&gt; 
            element, since the JavaScript will add an &lt;a&gt; element to create a 
            clickable zone. (It doesn‚Äôt make sense, anyway.)</p>
          <p><img src="r12a_blog_files/blockstructure.gif" alt=""></p>
          <p><em>The structure of the content in the example.</em></p>
          <h3>Setting up the markup</h3>
          <p>Very little change is required to the markup.</p>
          <div style="background-color: #993300; color: white; padding: 1em;">
            <p><strong>What I did</strong></p>
            <p>Add this to the document head:<br>
              <code>&lt;script src="expandcollapse.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>
              &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="expandcollapsestyle.css"/&gt;</code></p>
            <p>Add this to the body element start tag:<br>
              <code>onload="setCollapseExpand('otherNews', 'h3','');revealControl('On'); revealControl('Off');"</code></p>
            <p>Add this next to the RSS icon, just above the expanding content:<br>
              <code>&lt;a id="On" name="On" onclick="openAll('otherNews', 'h3','');" href="#_" class="hideIfNoJS"&gt;Open All&lt;/a&gt;<br>
              &lt;a id="Off" name="Off" onclick="closeAll('otherNews', 'h3','');" href="#_" class="hideIfNoJS"&gt;Close All&lt;/a&gt;<br>
              </code> </p>
          </div>
          <p>Notes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <pre>onload="setCollapseExpand('otherNews', 'h3','');"</pre>
              <p>After the document has loaded, this collapses the content.</p>
              <p>The JavaScript will look through the div with id <code>otherNews </code> for all h3 elements.  It then finds the parent of the h3 element, and 
                adds a class name to all the remaining elements after the h3 within that
                parent (a div, in our case).  The class is associated with styling that
                makes these elements disappear. It will also surround the contents of 
                the h3 element with an a element. This allows keyboard users to access 
                the functionality using tabs. Each a element is given an onclick 
                function to enable it to toggle the hidden content on or off.</p>
              <p>If we had wanted to use an ordinary p tag with a class name of, say, 
                trigger rather than the h3, the onload code would look like this:</p>
              <pre>onload="setCollapseExpand('otherNews', 'p','trigger');"</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Optional. You may want to add some buttons to expand and collapse all
                text in one go.  If so you‚Äôll need to add these to the markup.  In our 
                example I added the following code alongside the RSS feed icon. I used 
                an a element so that keyboard users can tab to it.</p>
              <pre>&lt;a id="On" name="On" onclick="openAll('otherNews', 'h3','');" 
   href="#_" class="hideIfNoJS"&gt;Open All&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a id="Off" name="Off" onclick="closeAll('otherNews', 'h3','');" 
   href="#_" class="hideIfNoJS"&gt;Close All&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
              <p>I added the class name hideIfNoJS to each a element.  We can now use CSS to hide this text unless JavaScript is detected.</p>
              <p>We then need to add two more statements to the onload value on the body tag, one for each a element.</p>
              <pre>revealControl('On'); revealControl('Off');</pre>
              <p>After the document loads, the JavaScript will remove those class names, and the switches will become visible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <pre>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="expandcollapsestyle.css"/&gt;</pre>
              <p>CSS will drive most of the behaviour.  The JavaScript simply changes 
                the class names associated with the markup. This references a stylesheet
                that will do all the hard lifting.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>A walk through the CSS</h3>
          <p>Let‚Äôs take a look at the CSS in the <a href="http://r12a.github.io/code/expandcollapse/expandcollapsestyle.css">expandcollapsestyle.css</a> file.</p>
          <p>First, we add some styling to the new ‚ÄòOpen All‚Äô and ‚ÄòClose All‚Äô text
            we added.  This will make this text look like small graphical buttons, 
            and change the cursor to a pointing hand as we mouse over them.</p>
          <pre>   a#On, a#Off {
      padding: 0.1em 0.5em 0.1em 0.5em;
      margin: 0 0.5em 0 0;
      text-decoration: none;
      background: #005a9c;
      color: #fc6;
      font-weight: bold;
      cursor: pointer;
      }
</pre>
          <p>Next, we add a rule to remove the ‚ÄòOpen All‚Äô and ‚ÄòClose All‚Äô buttons 
            from view initially.  The revealControl calls in the body onload 
            attribute will remove this class if JavaScript is enabled.</p>
          <pre>   .hideIfNoJS {
      display: none;
      }
</pre>
          <p>Now, we style the trigger text (in our case the h3 elements).</p>
          <p>The first set of rules makes the cursor become a pointer when we 
            mouse over the text, and adds a graphic to show whether the content is 
            revealed or not.</p>
          <pre>   .triggerOpen {
	background:url(http://www.w3.org/International/icons/open-thin.gif)
              no-repeat left 2px #fffaf0;
	}

   .triggerClosed {
	background:url(http://www.w3.org/International/icons/close-thin.gif)
              no-repeat left 2px #fffaf0;
	}
</pre>
          <p>You can, of course, change the styling to suit yourself.  For example, you may want to use a different graphic.</p>
          <p>We also fix the colour of the trigger text, pads the left side of the
            text so that you can see the graphic, and make the trigger change 
            colour as you mouse over it. (Note that the JavaScript has introduced 
            this a element.)</p>
          <pre>.triggerOpen a, .triggerClosed a {
	padding-left:14px;
	color:#000;
	text-decoration: none;
	cursor: pointer;
	}

.triggerOpen a:hover, .triggerClosed a:hover {
	color:#00f;
	}
</pre>
          <p>Finally, we add the styling for the content that will be 
            hidden/revealed.  The .hiddenContent class will be attached to content 
            by the JavaScript to hide it.</p>
          <pre>   .hiddenContent {
      display: none;
      }
</pre>
          <p>When that content is not hidden, it gets the revealedContent class.  
            We added some styling to pad the left side of the blocks by the same 
            amount as the trigger text.</p>
          <pre>   #otherNews .revealedContent {
      padding-left: 14px;
      }
   #otherNews ul.revealedContent {
      padding-left: 30px;
      margin-left: 0;
      }
</pre>
          <h3>The end result</h3>

          <p style="font-size: 80%; color: teal;">(I‚Äôm making notes here so I can find these techniques again later.)</p>
          <p>I wanted to use JavaScript (W3C DOM compliant) to wrap the content of a heading with an a element, ie. </p>
          <p>&lt;h3&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; header&lt;/h3&gt;</p>
          <p>Needed to become</p>

          <p>Here‚Äôs what I came up with:</p>
          <pre>var h = document.getElementBySomeMethod('h3'); // grab the heading
var a = document.createElement('a');       // create an a element
    a.setAttribute('href', '#mytarget');   // set the href
while (h.childNodes.length &gt; 0) {          // for each child node in the h3
    a.appendChild( content.firstChild );   // move the node to the a element
    }
h.appendChild(anchor);                    // stick a under the now empty h3
</pre>
          <p>It seems so simple now to look at.  Took me ages to figure it out. üôÅ</p>

          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Tue 13 Mar 2007 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>You should always use the lang and/or xml:lang attributes in HTML or
            XHTML to identify the human language of the content so that 
            applications such as voice browsers, style sheets, and the like can 
            process that text. (See <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/language-decl/">Declaring Language in XHTML and HTML</a> for the details.) </p>
          <p>You can override that language setting for a part of the document 
            that is in a different language, eg. some French quotation in an English
            document, by using the same attribute(s) around the relevant bit of 
            text.</p>
          <p>Suppose you have some text that is not in any language, such as type 
            samples, part numbers, perhaps program code.  How would you say that 
            this was no language in particular?</p>
          <p>There are a number of possible approaches:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>A few years ago we introduced into the XML spec the idea that 
                xml:lang=‚Äù‚Äù conveys that ‚Äòthere is no language information available‚Äô. 
                (See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-lang-tag">2.12 Language Identification</a>)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>An alternative is to use the value ‚Äòund‚Äô, for ‚Äòundetermined‚Äô. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In the IANA Subtag Registry there is another tag, ‚Äòzxx‚Äô, that means 
                ‚ÄòNo linguistic content‚Äô.  Perhaps this is a better choice. It has my 
                vote at the moment.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>xml:lang=‚Äù‚Äù</strong> Is ‚Äòno language information available‚Äô suitable to express ‚Äòthis is not a language‚Äô?  My feeling is not.</p>
          <p>If it were appropriate, there are some other questions to be answered
            here. With HTML an empty string value for the lang or xml:lang 
            attribute produces a validation error. </p>
          <p>It seems to me that the validator should not produce an error for xml:lang=‚Äù‚Äù. It needs to be fixed.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôm not clear whether the HTML DTD supports an empty string value for
            lang. If so, the presumably the validator needs to be fixed.  If not, 
            then this is not a viable option, since you‚Äôd really want both lang and 
            xml:lang to have the same values.</p>
          <p><strong>und</strong> Would the description ‚Äòundetermined‚Äô fit this 
            case, given that it is not a language at all? Again, it doesn‚Äôt seem 
            right to me, since ‚Äòundetermined‚Äô seems to suggest that it is a language
            of some sort, but we‚Äôre not sure which.</p>
          <p><strong>zxx</strong> This seems to be the right choice for me.  It 
            would produce no validation issues.  The only issue is perhaps that it‚Äôs
            not terrible memorable.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Spell checking and language tags in XMetal</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Fri 9 Mar 2007 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I use XMetal 4.6 for all my XHTML and XML authoring.  As someone who
            has been advocating for some time that you should always declare the 
            human language of your content when creating Web content, I‚Äôm finding 
            XMetal‚Äôs spell checker both exciting and frustrating. Here are a few 
            tips that might help others.</p>
          <p>The exciting part is that XMetal figures out which spell checker to 
            use based on the xml:lang language declarations. Given the following 
            code:</p>
          <pre>&lt;html xml:lang="en-us" lang="en-us" ... &gt; 
...
&lt;p&gt;behavior localization color&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;behaviour localisation colour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"&gt;ceci est fran√ßais&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang="gr" xml:lang="gr"&gt;ŒöŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ œÑŒøŒΩ Œ†Œ±Œ≥Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒπŒø ŒôœÉœÑœå œÄœÅŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫Œ¨ Œ†Œ±Œ≥Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒπŒø&lt;/p&gt;
...
</pre>
          <p>The spell checker will recognize three errors (behaviour localisation
            colour).  The en-us value in the html tag causes it to use the 
            US-English spell check dictionary, and the fr and gr values in the last 
            two paragraphs cause it to use a French and Greek dictionary, 
            respectively, for the words in those elements. Great!</p>
          <p><a href="http://r12a.github.io/images/xmetalspellcheck.gif"><img style="margin: 1em; margin-left: 0; border: dotted 1px teal; padding: 4px;" src="r12a_blog_files/xmetalspellcheck.gif" alt="Picture of the spell checker in action."></a></p>
          <p>Note that, since XMetal is an XML editor, rather than an HTML editor,
            it is the value in the xml:lang attribute rather than the one in the 
            lang attribute that counts here. For XHTML 1.0 content served as 
            text/html, of course, <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/language-decl/#Slide0160">you should use both</a>.</p>
          <p>The following, however, are <strong>things you need to watch out for</strong>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>If your html tag contains just xml:lang=‚Äùen‚Äù your spell checking 
                won‚Äôt be terribly effective, since all the English dictionaries (US, UK,
                Australia, and Canada) will be used. This means that for the code above
                you will receive no error notifications, since each spelling occurs in 
                at least one dictionary.</p>
              <p>This is logical enough, though it‚Äôs something you may not think about
                when spell checking. (Even if you go into the spell checker options and
                set, say, the US English spell checker, the language declaration will 
                override that manual choice.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If you want to write British English, you would normally put en-GB in the xml:lang (because that‚Äôs what <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/">BCP 47 says you should do</a>).
                Unfortunately this will produce no errors with our test case above! 
                XMetal doesn‚Äôt recognise the GB subtag, and reverts to xml:lang=‚Äùen‚Äù. To
                get the behaviour you are expecting you have to put en-UK in xml:lang. 
                This is really bad.  It means you are marking up your content 
                incorrectly. Presumably the same holds true for other languages.  I see 
                CF for Canadian French, rather than CA, SD for Swiss German rather than 
                CH, etc.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>It‚Äôs good to see that the language markup <em>is</em> being used for spell-checking. However, it‚Äôs a case of two steps forward, one step back.  Which is a shame.</p>

          <p style="margin-top: 3em;"><strong>Plotting points while taking photos.</strong> I carry around a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/GPS_Reviews#NaviGPS_.2F_.28B.29GT-11">GPS device (NaviGPS)</a> that plots points at intervals you can choose.  I usually opt for every 5 seconds. The device is really <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ishida/201608275/">light, small</a> and waterproof.  Main problems:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Finding something to carry it in.  I can‚Äôt seem to find the armband 
              Scytex describes, and though carrying it in my trouser pocket worked 
              reasonably well, I think it was sub-optimal.  I recently acquired a 
              small thin bag that clips onto my backpack or camera bag.</li>
            <li>Buildings can block the signal.  This was an issue recently in the 
              narrow streets of Oviedo‚Äôs old town.  But it‚Äôs usually fine, and even in
              Oviedo produced usable results.</li>
            <li>Although the plots are usually incredibly accurate, there are 
              occasions where parts of the track seems slightly displaced from the 
              route you can see on Google Earth.  I don‚Äôt know whether this is because
              Google Earth is slightly incorrect or the GPS points are slightly off. 
              (See how I deal with that below.)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I also try to remember to synchronise, as GMT, the data/time in my 
            camera with the date/time in the GPS device before I set off (although 
            you‚Äôll read later that I have a way of dealing with this if I forget).</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 4em;"><strong>Converting points to tracks.</strong> When I get back to my computer, it takes about 10 seconds to upload the
            data from the GPS device to a folder using a USB cable.  The resulting 
            file has a .nmea extension and contains information about latitude, 
            longitude, elevation, etc, and a timestamp for each point plotted. (<a href="http://r12a.github.io/gps/hyderabad.nmea">Example</a>.)</p>
          <p>I use a small Python script I wrote to convert that to a .kml file 
            that can be viewed on Google Earth or Google Maps. (The code is given 
            below.)    The script takes about one second to run. The result is a 
            line that joins all the ‚Äòdots‚Äô together, and provides timestamp 
            information and elevation data on the left of the screen for each 
            5-second plot that links to the the appropriate place on the map.  (See 
            the picture below.)</p>
          <p>The program lets me add a positive or negative offset, in seconds, if
            I have forgotten to synch the camera and the gps device, and adjusts 
            the times of the plots to match those on the photos.</p>
          <p>See the example of <a href="http://r12a.github.io/gps/0701-punakha-route.kml">this recent trip in Bhutan</a>.
            The file at the end of that link is a particularly large file ‚Äì 1.3Mb ‚Äì
            since it contains annotations for 5-second plots over a period of 
            around 12 hours. Usually my files are only a fraction of this size. (I 
            often produce the track plot without the annotations. In this case, even
            this 12-hour file would only be <a href="http://r12a.github.io/gps/0701-punakha-route-small.kml">about 248k</a>.)
            Note: There is one long straight line in that plot ‚Äì this was due to 
            the GPS device being inadvertently turned off at one stage.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 4em;"><strong>Adding geo data to my photos.</strong> After adding XMP data to my photos about location, title, etc, using 
            Adobe CS2 Bridge, I also add latitude and longitude to the exif data 
            using Picassa and Google Earth.</p>
          <p>The beta version of Picassa allows you to add latitude and longitude 
            to your photo‚Äôs exif data by visually locating a point on Google Earth.</p>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="http://r12a.github.io/gps/picassa-geotag.jpg"><img src="r12a_blog_files/picassa-geotag.jpg" alt="Click to see the full picture." title="Click to see the full picture."></a></p>
          <p><em title="Caption">Picture of the menu selection in Picassa.</em></p>
          <p>You can assign geodata for batches of photos or individual photos.  
            You just line up the target icon with the right place on the map and hit
            the Geotag button. (See the picture below, showing me about to line up a
            location with the target icon.) </p>
          <p>In principle, to find the right place on the map, I click on the 
            nearest timestamp to the left (see 092535 in the picture below, which 
            was the time in GMT when I took the photo of the tree, bottom right) to 
            identify the position, and then move the map until that position is 
            below the target.  In practice, I can usually remember and see where I 
            was standing relative to a given landmark or street corner, etc, and I 
            move that under the target.  If the GE definition is not high for that 
            area however, I use the timestamp on the photo and the plot trace on 
            Google Earth. </p>
          <p>Where there‚Äôs a discrepancy, I don‚Äôt know whether my gps plot or the 
            Google Earth map is most correct, but I opt for the visual approach 
            because when I use this data it is typically to show my location on 
            Google Earth/Maps. So I try to sync to what I see (and cross my fingers 
            that things won‚Äôt change when GE rephotographs that location).</p>
          <p>If I can‚Äôt tell within a (very) few metres where I was standing, I don‚Äôt geotag my photo.</p>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="http://r12a.github.io/gps/geotag-gearth.jpg"><img src="r12a_blog_files/geotag-gearth.jpg" alt="Click to see the full picture." title="Click to see the full picture."></a></p>
          <p><em title="Caption">Picture of Google Earth just before I position the map for a particular photo and hit the Geotag button.</em></p>
          <p>The one fly in the ointment here is that I can‚Äôt use Picassa to tag 
            my RAW files in this way ‚Äì which is a pain, because using Adobe CS I‚Äôm 
            able to add all the other metadata I want.  I‚Äôm hoping Picassa may do 
            something about this soon, or (perhaps even better for me) that Adobe 
            will add similar capabilities to Picassa for tagging photos from Adobe 
            Bridge with Google Earth‚Ä¶  For now, I just get by as best I can.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 4em;"><strong>Uploading the geodata.</strong> When I upload a photo to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ishida/">Flickr </a>or <a href="http://www.panoramio.com/user/144501">Panoramio</a>, the exif geodata is read automatically and used to establish the location on their maps.</p>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="http://r12a.github.io/gps/flickr-map.jpg"><img src="r12a_blog_files/flickr-map.jpg" alt="Click to see the full picture." title="Click to see the full picture."></a></p>
          <p><em title="Caption">Picture of a photo on Flickr showing how it locates the place the photo was taken on Yahoo maps.</em></p>
          <p style="margin-top: 4em;"><strong>Using the geodata.</strong> Once I have the geodata in the photo‚Äôs metadata, I can use it in a number of ways.</p>
          <p>I can extract it to label a photo, as in <a href="http://r12a.github.io/photos/slide.php?set=0701-dochula&amp;slide=2">this example</a> (click on ‚Äòshow detail‚Äô). This has advantages such as: (a) a reader can
            easily get at the data, eg. to cut and paste the coordinates into 
            Google Earth or Google Maps to see where the photo was taken, (b) if the
            copy of the photo itself no longer contains the metadata (as in this 
            case), the data is still available. (Note: the full-sized version of the
            photo linked from that page does contain the exif data.)</p>
          <p>For my sets on Flickr, I also run some simple <a href="#code">Python scripts</a> to create a .kml file which shows the location of each photo on Google 
            Earth or Google Maps.  I just upload the .kml file to a server, and you 
            can access the information from a simple HTML link.   Try this example 
            of photos taken at the Golconda Fort, Hyderabad, on either <a href="http://r12a.github.io/gps/0701-hyderabad1.kml">Google Earth</a> or <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http://r12a.github.io/gps/0701-hyderabad1.kml">Google Maps</a>.  If you click on the icons you see on the map, you can see the view I had from that position.</p>
          <p><a target="_blank" href="http://r12a.github.io/gps/gearth-set.jpg"><img src="r12a_blog_files/gearth-set.jpg" alt="Click to see the full picture." title="Click to see the full picture."></a></p>

          <p style="margin-top: 4em;"><strong><a name="code" id="code">Python code.</a></strong></p>
          <p>This is the code I use to convert the .nmea data to an annotated .kml
            file.  Before the script runs you are asked to input the name of the 
            file to be converted and any offset needed (in seconds) to synchronise 
            the camera time with the time in the  gps device (this can be a positive
            or negative number or zero).</p>

          <p>I had been excited at the chance to visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan">Bhutan</a> for some months, and having just returned, I have to say that I wasn‚Äôt 
            disappointed at all.  In fact, it was better than I dared hope.</p>
          <p>The whole country is a photographer‚Äôs paradise.  The dzongs and 
            monasteries are all beautiful.  But so are the people.  So calm and 
            friendly. (And more stunningly gorgeous women per capita than anywhere 
            else I‚Äôve seen!)</p>
          <p>Part of that is surely helped by the fact that the total population 
            of Bhutan, in a country the size of Switzerland, is only around 600,000.
            The population of the capital Thimpu is about the same as that of a 
            small town (approx 30,000).  While this is surely a disadvantage for 
            building infrastructure etc, I suspect it has its upside too. Every time
            I went anywhere with Bhutanese people we bumped into others that they 
            knew.  I‚Äôm sure this helps make the place seem safer and less 
            isolating/depersonalising than any other capital city I‚Äôve visited.</p>
          <p>People you meet look you in the eye, and have a ready smile.</p>
          <p>I was also amazed at the degree to which Bhuddism is integrated into 
            the daily lives of the people ‚Äì even when they watch Western television 
            all the time.</p>
          <p>The only trouble with this is that it is so hard/expensive to return.
            I was there at the invitation of a government department for a <a href="http://www.panl10n.net/english/Activity20.htm">regional consultation on local language computing</a>,
            but to visit as a tourist you have to be on a package tour that will 
            cost you in the region of 240 USD per day.  This keeps the number of 
            tourists down to around 17,000 last year, 14,000 the year before 
            (although that figure will rise significantly this and next year).  All 
            that, however, is probably a very good thing. I‚Äôd hate to see the place 
            spoiled by tourism. I do hope I‚Äôll make it back some day.</p>
          <p>I have only just begun uploading my photos, though I started with a bang.  My first batch are of <a href="https://r12a.github.io/photos/sets/thumbs.php?set=0701-dochula">Dochu La</a> (Dochu Pass).  At around 3,100 metres, way above the clouds and with a 
            thin layer of snow over the colourful chortens, I felt a bit like I was 
            in heaven.  More to come over the next couple of weeks or so‚Ä¶</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Tibetan character picker</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Mon 6 Nov 2006 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=apps">apps</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=pickers">pickers</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=tibetan">tibetan</a> &nbsp; </p>

          <p><a href="http://r12a.github.io/pickers/tibetan/">New picker</a></p>
          <p>I finally got around to studying the Tibetan script.  To help with that I created a Tibetan picker.</p>
          <p>This picker includes all the characters in the Unicode Tibetan block.</p>
          <p>The default shows all characters as images due to the rarity of 
            Tibetan fonts. Consonants are mostly in a typical articulatory 
            arrangement, with vowels below, and digits in keypad order.</p>
          <p>Since characters cover the whole Tibetan block, there are many 
            characters that are used for transcriptions rather than just the 
            characters needed for ordinary Tibetan text.  There are also many 
            symbols, and three characters that are not in the Tibetan block itself. I
            tried to arrange things so that the most commonly used characters for 
            Tibetan or Dzonkha are easy to get at, but I‚Äôm open to suggestions.</p>
          <p>Note that the <a href="http://www.thdl.org/xml/show.php?xml=/tools/tibfonts.xml&amp;l=uva10928423419921">Tibetan Machine Uni</a> font I use as a default setting is an OpenType font that requires 
            version 1.453.3665.0 or later of the Uniscribe engine (usp10.dll). So 
            the output is not ideal in my browser.  Works fine if you cut and paste 
            into MS Word though. üôÅ</p>
          <p>Enjoy.</p>
          <p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
          <p>I installed a later version of uniscribe, and now my Tibetan text 
            looks fine in the browser as well as in Office.  On my previous laptop I
            just used a <a href="http://www.thdl.org/xml/showEssay.php?xml=/tools/fonts/unicode-explain-eng.xml">small tool</a> that‚Äôs downloadable from the Tibetan &amp; Himalayan Digital Library.  
            My new laptop, however, didn‚Äôt work with that tool ‚Äì I‚Äôve no idea why.  
            So I had to resort to using the <a href="http://www.thdl.org/xml/showEssay.php?xml=/tools/fonts/unisupport.xml&amp;l=d1e370">Windows Recovery Console</a>.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôm already subscribed to Microsoft Volt, so I used the <a href="http://groups.msn.com/MicrosoftVOLTuserscommunity/homepage.msnw?pgmarket=en-us">latest uniscribe version</a> from there, dated 4 jan 2006.</p>

          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Tue 31 Oct 2006 tagged as  <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I‚Äôve been lucky enough to have access to a pre-publication 
            electronic version of the new Unicode Standard 5 book, and though I‚Äôve 
            been terribly busy just lately, I‚Äôve carved out a little time to read 
            and even use some of it. And I like what I see.</p>
          <p>I‚Äôve always thought the Unicode book was a really useful thing to 
            have if you need to understand the ins-and-outs of Unicode for 
            implementation purposes, or if you are simply interested in how scripts 
            work.  It has always been relatively easy to read, and more like a 
            guidebook than a standard, if you know what I mean.  The good news is 
            that that seems to be even more the case in the latest version.  There 
            are lots of small edits that improve the clarity of the text and make it
            more readable.</p>
          <div>
            <div style="float:right; color: brown; width: 30%; padding: 0 0 1em 1em;">In
              simple terms, a grapheme cluster is a sequence of characters that need 
              to be kept together for things like wrapping text at the end of a line, 
              cursor movement, delete, etc.</div>
            <p>There are, however, some more significant changes that are also very 
              welcome.  For example, I‚Äôve been looking at first-letter styling in CSS 
              recently, particularly in the context of Indian scripts, but despite a 
              lot of searching I was unable to figure out where the Standard actually 
              told me that a default grapheme cluster didn‚Äôt cover a whole Indic 
              syllable.   The grapheme cluster concept is really quite an important 
              one for implementations, and it was frustrating to see it described so 
              poorly. </p>
          </div>
          <p>All that has changed with extensive additions to Chapter 3.  Now 
            section 3.6 Combination contains a substantial amount of new text that 
            explains grapheme clusters quite clearly.  Again, don‚Äôt be put off by 
            the dour-sounding title for Chapter 3, Conformance.  It contains lots of
            useful definitions and explanations in the typical clear and succinct 
            style of the book.</p>
          <p>I have to admit to a tinge of disappointment that the Standard 
            Annexes which are now included in the book have simply been added as 
            appendices, rather than integrated into the text proper.  My evaluation 
            copy didn‚Äôt actually contain this text, so I can‚Äôt comment further, 
            however. </p>
          <p>Also, I had decided a short while ago that I need to finally get to 
            grips with Tibetan script, and some urgency has been added to that given
            that I will visit Bhutan in January.  I was disappointed, therefore, to
            find that the section on Tibetan script had not been edited at all.  
            That section has always been substandard, to my mind, in terms of 
            clarity and writing style. </p>
          <p>On the other hand, I see that useful additions have been made to 
            existing block descriptions elsewhere (such as a useful additional 
            section on Rendering of Thai Combining Marks in the Thai description). I
            see similar additions to block descriptions such as Lao, Gujarati and 
            Gurmukhi, and the Bengali block description seems to have been largely 
            rewritten.  I‚Äôm looking forward to getting my teeth into those and also 
            the numerous, enticing new block descriptions, such as Phags-pa, N‚Äôko, 
            Sumer-Akkadian (cuneiform) and the like.</p>
          <p>So would I recommend it?  Certainly.  The Unicode Standard is a mine 
            of useful and accessible information if, as I said, you are implementing
            Unicode-based applications or you are interested in how scripts work.  
            And it‚Äôs worth replacing your previous version, not only because the new
            smaller format will make it much easier to handle and keep on your 
            bookshelf, but because of the value of the many useful additions.  I‚Äôll 
            be picking up my copy at the Unicode Conference in Washington next 
            month.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">I think IE7 may break language negotiation on many servers</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Wed 18 Oct 2006 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <div style="float:right; color: brown; width: 30%; padding: 0 0 1em 1em;">Some
            people have construed this as an attack on IE7. It is absolutely not. 
            I‚Äôm trying to be helpful. Microsoft has always taken great care not to 
            break things for their customers when releasing new browser versions.  
            I‚Äôm just trying point out an issue I think they may have missed. The 
            title summarises the issue.</div>
          <p>The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/17/accept-language-header-for-internet-explorer-7.aspx">IE7 blog</a> just announced Microsoft‚Äôs intention to change the way browser 
            preferences for Accept-language are set up by default.  Basically your 
            preferences will no longer, by default, be set to <code>fr</code> if you‚Äôre French, but to <code>fr-FR</code> instead, ie. your locale as determined by Windows settings.</p>
          <p>I think this is going to cause major problems with content negotiation on the Web.</p>
          <p>To give a practical example:<br>
            Set your language settings to just es-MX and/or es-ES and point your browser to <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-priorities">this article</a> on the W3C site (an article explaining how to set language preferences).</p>
          <p>You‚Äôll get back the English version, even though there‚Äôs a Spanish version there. Someone with <code>es</code> set in IE6, Opera or Firefox will see the Spanish version automatically ‚Äì even if their preferences are <code>es-MX</code> then <code>es</code>.</p>
          <p>This is down to the way language negotiation is done on the Apache server.</p>
          <p>In the article linked to above we explain that ‚ÄúSome of the 
            server-side language selection mechanisms require an exact match to the 
            Accept-Language header. If a document on the server is tagged as fr 
            (French) then a request for a document matching fr-CH (Swiss French) 
            will fail. To ensure success you should configure your browser to 
            request both fr-CH and fr.‚Äù</p>
          <p>This is from the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/en/content-negotiation.html#exceptions">Apache 2 documentation</a>:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The server will also attempt to match language-subsets 
              when no other match can be found. For example, if a client requests 
              documents with the language en-GB for British English, the server is not
              normally allowed by the HTTP/1.1 standard to match that against a 
              document that is marked as simply en. (Note that it is almost surely a 
              configuration error to include en-GB and not en in the Accept-Language 
              header, since it is very unlikely that a reader understands British 
              English, but doesn‚Äôt understand English in general. Unfortunately, many 
              current clients have default configurations that resemble this.)</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Apache 2 introduces ‚Äúsome exceptions ‚Ä¶ to the negotiation algorithm 
            to allow graceful fallback when language negotiation fails to find a 
            match‚Äù, but those using Apache 1 don‚Äôt have that luxury.</p>
          <p>Apart from the fact that most users wouldn‚Äôt even know that they can 
            set their browser preferences differently, not to mention knowing how to
            do that, IE7 CR1 doesn‚Äôt even provide a preset selection for es rather 
            than <code>es-ES</code> ‚Äì you have to enter it manually.  Not likely to happen much.</p>
          <p>It seems to me that a simple fix to this would be for IE7 to set the user‚Äôs default preferences to *also* include <code>es</code> (ie. <code>es-ES, es</code> for Spain, <code>fr-FR, fr</code> for France, etc.).  Then, when a file such as 
            qa-lang-priorities.fr-fr.html is not found, the server will find 
            qa-lang-priorities.fr.html and return a French file.  Those people who 
            want to know where the user‚Äôs browser is (likely to be) physically 
            located can still use the fr-FR information to get the locale.</p>
          <p>I think that the result of ignoring this is that many people will be 
            confused about why they no longer see a page in Spanish, when they did 
            before, and a lot of hard work by content developers will go unnoticed 
            on the Web.  In short, think Microsoft is about to introduce a serious 
            bug into IE7.</p>
          <p style="border: 1px solid teal; padding: 1em;">Note, in passing, that 
            the rules for specifying the lang attribute in HTML and xml:lang in 
            XHTML are described by BCP47.  The latest syntax and matching 
            specifications are RFC4646 and RFC4647 ‚Äì which obsolete RFC 3066 and RFC
            1766, and which tells you to go to the IANA Language Subtag Registry at <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry">http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry</a> to find out what language codes to use, rather than the ISO code lists.  For more information, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/">http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/</a> )</p>
          <p style="font-size: 80%; color: teal;">Btw, I tried posting this as a comment on the IE7 blog page, but it didn‚Äôt work (site busy) so I did it here.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">How useful is :lang ?</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Wed 18 Oct 2006 tagged as <a href="/blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="/blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I got an email this morning asking for some use cases for the CSS <code>:lang</code> selector.  Here are some ideas. This should help content authors 
            understand how using :lang can sometimes be better than other approaches
            when selecting content for styling. Of course, not all user agents 
            support :lang, and hopefully these use cases will also show how enabling
            support could be useful. </p>
          <h3>Use case 1</h3>
          <p>One of the main cases where I want to use :lang is when I have a page
            that includes numerous short pieces of text in a different script.  
            Take, for example, <a href="http://r12a.github.io/scripts/scriptnotes/myanmar/">my notes on the Myanmar script</a>. In such cases I want to assign a particular font and perhaps font-size, etc, to the numerous Myanmar examples.</p>
          <p>It does my head in trying to ensure that I labelled all the myanmar 
            text with class attributes so that I get the right font and colour 
            applied.  And it‚Äôs frustrating, because all I‚Äôm doing is repeating 
            information that‚Äôs there already in the <code>lang</code> attribute (and in the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute too, given that this is xhtml). </p>
          <p>Adding <code>class="my"</code> everywhere also bulks up the document.  Even in this smallish document, it adds over 1K to the page size.</p>
          <p>It would make life a lot easier to just include a single CSS rule:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><code>:lang(my) { font-family: myanmar1, sans-serif; color:red; font-size: 130%; }</code></p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Use case 2</h3>
          <p>Suppose you have the following Japanese text in an English document:</p>
          <blockquote xml:lang="ja" lang="ja">
            <p>&lt;blockquote lang=‚Äùja‚Äù xml:lang=‚Äùja‚Äù&gt;„ÉØ„Éº„É´„Éâ„Éª„ÉØ„Ç§„Éâ„Éª„Ç¶„Çß„ÉÉ„Éñ„Çí&lt;em&gt;‰∏ñÁïå‰∏≠&lt;/em&gt;„Å´Â∫É„Åí„Åæ„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Now suppose you want to apply different emphasis styling to the 
            Japanese text, since italicisation doesn‚Äôt work well for ideographic 
            scripts in small font sizes.  Let‚Äôs suppose we wanted to add the 
            proposed <a href="http://r12a.github.io/scripts/tutorial/slides/Slide1400.html">wakiten</a> emphasis style that CSS3 describes.  How do you make that happen?</p>
          <p>Well, ideally, you‚Äôd just add the following rule to your CSS, and all would be taken care of:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><code>em:lang(ja) { font-emphasize: dot before; font-style: normal; }</code></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>(‚ÄúWhen you encounter an <code>em</code> tag and the language is Japanese use wakiten and remove the italics.‚Äù)</p>
          <p>If you‚Äôre dealing with IE6 <code>:lang</code> is not supported, and 
            you‚Äôd actually have to add a special class to each and every emphasis 
            tag embedded in Japanese text and use a rule such as </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><code>em.ja { ... }</code></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>How annoying is that!</p>
          <p>IE7 CR1 supports the CSS selectors <code>lang |= </code>and l<code>ang =</code>.  Aha! you might think, problem solved.  We can use the following rule:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><code>em[lang |= 'ja'] { ... }</code></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>But you‚Äôd be wrong.  This only works if the language is declared on the <code>em</code> element itself.  So you‚Äôd still have to go through and add <code>lang="ja" xml:lang="ja"</code> to each <code>em</code> element ‚Äì even though you have already declared that the whole blockquote is in Japanese!</p>
          <h3>Use case 3</h3>
          <p>This use case is slightly less mainstream, but I think it presents a 
            slightly different use case, but one which is increasingly common with 
            the increase in multilingual blogs and AJAX powered pages. It applies 
            when you include text into a page that comes from another environment, 
            either by cut &amp; paste, or by automatic means, and you don‚Äôt have the
            styling information that was associated with it originally. </p>
          <p>Assuming that the text has language attributes, or that you can apply
            those, you could have a set of default rules in your environment that, 
            say, apply a nastaliq font with a percentage size scaling factor to all 
            text in Urdu, so that it has some styling at least, and is a reasonable 
            size relative to the Latin text.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p> For example, if I cut and paste some Urdu text into this blog, it could make the difference between seeing this:<br>
              <img src="r12a_blog_files/urdu1.gif" alt="Text in English and Urdu without styling."></p>
            <p>and this:<br>
              <img src="r12a_blog_files/urdu2.gif" alt="Text in English and Urdu with styling."> </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Adding, once, a couple of rules in your blog css that say: </p>
          <p><code>:lang(ur) { font-family: standardMSUrdufont, standardMacUrdufont, standardUnixUrdufont, serif; font-size: 140%; }</code><br>
            <code>em:lang(ur) { font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; }</code></p>
          <p>would be preferable to having to add extra inline markup to the text as you add it to your blog each time.</p>
          <p>As a similar example, I just released the latest version of the <a href="http://r12a.github.io/uniview/descn.html">UniView tool</a> (a kind of web-based Character Map on steroids).  It includes a 
            facility that allows you to write your own notes about characters in a 
            separate document and see the relevant notes when looking up a specific 
            character.  The information is sucked in using AJAX features. See <a href="#note1">[1]</a>. </p>
          <p>We do not at the moment try to incorporate/recognize the other 
            document‚Äôs style rules when the notes are displayed in UniView, however,
            while keeping things simple, it may be useful to allow the UniView user
            switch on or off some very general default style rules specifying fonts
            and/or font sizing to text marked up for a particular language.</p>
          <p>As long as the code is marked up for language, such defaults can be 
            applied regardless of what class names or styling appeared in the 
            original document.  Of course, :lang would be very useful in this 
            respect.</p>
          <div class="note">
            <p><a name="note1" id="note1">[1]</a> To see this example<br>
              a. open <a href="http://r12a.github.io/uniview/">UniView</a><br>
              b. where it says ‚ÄúSelect a range to display‚Äù select Myanmar<br>
              c. click on character 1004 and see the description on the right<br>
              d. now click on the icon with a + sign between Notes: and Search string: fields<br>
              e. from the menu select Myanmar block and say ok, and dismiss the pop up<br>
              f. now click on character 1004 again, and see the notes added to the description on the right ‚Äì these notes came from an <a href="http://r12a.github.io/uniview/notes/myanmar.xml">XML file</a> (see the <a href="http://r12a.github.io/uniview/notes/myanmar.html">same file served as xhtml</a>)</p>
            <p>(Anyone can write such a document, stick it on a server and include 
              its information in UniView.  The only requirement is that the notes you 
              want to appear be surrounded by &lt;div class=‚Äùnotes‚Äù 
              id=‚ÄùC[hexCodepoint]‚Äù&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. The example above is one such file
              supplied with UniView.)</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p><a href="http://r12a.github.io/uniview/">New version</a></p>
          <p>This is a major new release of UniView, bringing it up to date with 
            the Unicode Standard version 5.0.0, but also improving the user 
            interface and adding AJAX links to supplementary notes.</p>
          <p>Changes: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Updated to support Unicode 5.0.0.</li>
            <li>Restyled the menu panels, moving some less used functions to pop up windows to save on horizontal space.</li>
            <li>Implemented an AJAX approach for incorporating notes files.  This 
              means that the page no longer has to be reloaded to add notes.  It is 
              now also possible to add more than one set of notes at a time.  Note 
              that these changes requires a small change to  the markup of notes files
              ‚Äì the div containing the notes for display has to have a class name 
              ‚Äònotes‚Äô as well as the id for the character.</li>
            <li>I added some bundled notes files ‚Äì most notably myanmar. Note that these are subject to change on an ongoing basis.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Most of the properties display in the character-detail panel on the 
            right are taken from the unicodedata file at the moment.  I plan to 
            incorporate additional property information over the coming months, but 
            wanted to release this now so that you can get information about Unicode
            5 characters sooner rather than later.</p>

          <p>I just returned from the <a href="http://www.fundamentosweb.org/2006/">Fundamentos Web Conference</a> in Oviedo, Spain.  What a good experience that was, on several levels. 
            My talk seems to have been appreciated, the audience was really nice, 
            and it was great to finally, after 20 years, be back in Spain again.  
            (Sorry, those of you in Barcelona, but Catalonia feels a little 
            different from the Spain that I remember from my younger days.;-)</p>
          <p>There were also a bunch of great talks. (I was very impressed by Vint
            Cerf‚Äôs remote participation too.) And it was great to see the wide 
            coverage of the event in <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/fundamentos%20web">blogs</a> and media.  It felt like you were really at an important nerve centre of the Spanish IT world for a couple of days.</p>
          <p>I have posted some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=fundamentos%20web%202006&amp;w=36887937%40N00">photos of the second day of the event</a> on Flickr already, with some photos taken <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=36887937%40N00&amp;q=oviedo&amp;m=text">around and about Oviedo</a>. (I didn‚Äôt have my camera on the first day).</p>
          <p>Much of the time it was raining ‚Äì it‚Äôs odd that the weather in the UK
            was actually better than Spain. On Thursday, though, we had splendid, 
            basically cloudless, weather all day and I had the very enjoyable 
            company of Bob Regan, Chris Wilson, Dave Shea, Kevin Yank, and later 
            David Storey, for a long walk around Oviedo taking pictures.  Oviedo 
            sparkled. I have still to upload these photos, but I think they will be 
            worth the wait ‚Äì nearly all of them came out really well.</p>
          <p>Later that day Jos√© Alonso and Luis Villa took us for a slap up lunch
            and a tour of Mount Naranco that added even more wonderful views to our
            day.  I‚Äôd like to thank all at the Spanish W3C Office and Luis for 
            really taking exceptionally good care of the speakers all week.</p>
