<p><strong>About the tool:</strong> Look up and see characters (using 
graphics or fonts) and property information, view whole character blocks
 or custom ranges, select characters to paste into your document, paste 
in and discover unknown characters, search for characters, do 
hex/dec/ncr conversions, highlight character types, etc. etc. Supports 
Unicode 5.2 and written with Web Standards to work on a variety of 
browsers. No need to install anything.</p>
<p><strong>Latest changes:</strong> The major change in this update is the addition of a function, <span class="onscreen">Show age</span>,
 to show the version of Unicode where a character was added (after 
version 1.1). The same information is also listed in the details given 
for a character in the lower right panel.</p>
<p>The trigger for context-sensitive help was reduced to the first 
character of a command name, rather than the whole command name. This 
improves behaviour for commands under <span class="onscreen">More actions</span> by allowing you to click on the command name rather than just the icon alongside to activate the command. </p>
<p>Some ‘quick start’ instructions were also added to the initial 
display to orient people new to the tool, and this help text was updated
 in various areas.</p>
<p style="">The highlighting mechanism was changed. Rather than 
highlight characters using a coloured border (which is typically not 
very visible), highlighting now works by greying out characters that are
 not highlighted. This also makes it clearer when nothing is 
highlighted.</p>
<p style="">In the recent past, when you converted a matrix to a list in
 the lower left panel, greyed-out rows would be added for 
non-characters. These are no longer displayed. Consequently, the command
 to remove such rows from the list (previously under <span class="onscreen">More actions</span>) has been removed.</p>
<p>A lot of invisible work went into replacing style attributes in the 
code with class names. This produces better source code, but doesn’t 
affect the user experience.</p>

<p>If you’re interested, I just did a major overhaul of my <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/bengali/">script notes on Bengali</a>
 in Unicode. There’s a new section about which characters to use when 
there are multiple options (eg. RRA vs. DDA+nukta), and the page 
provides information about more characters from the Bengali block in 
Unicode (including those used in Bengali’s amazingly complicated 
currency notation prior to 1957).</p>
<p>In addition, this has all  been squeezed into the latest look and feel for script notes pages.</p>
<p>The new page is at a new location.  There is a redirect on the old page.</p>
<p>Hope it’s useful.

<p><strong>About the tools:</strong> Pickers allow you to quickly create
 phrases in a script by clicking on Unicode characters arranged in a way
 that aids their identification. Pickers are likely to be most useful if
 you don’t know a script well enough to use the native keyboard. The 
arrangement of characters also makes it much more usable than a regular 
character map utility</p>
<p><strong>Latest changes:</strong> The <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/urdu/">Urdu </a> and <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/tamil/">Tamil</a>
 pickers have been upgraded to version 10.  This provides new views of 
the data, but also involved a thorough overhaul and redesign of the 
pickers.  Transliteration functions have also been added for the Tamil 
picker.</p>
<p>In addition, the <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/urdu/">Urdu notes page</a> was updated and a new <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/tamil/">Tamil notes page</a>
 was created.  Database entries were also updated or, in the case of 
Tamil, created to support the notes pages.  These notes pages are the 
first to use a new look and feel, based on the analyse-string tool I 
produced earlier this year.  This adds information about each character 
from the Unicode descriptions data to that from my own database.

<p>I like your pickers and what is appealing even more is that you’ve added transliteration, which is a very nice feature for any picker.</p>

you don’t know a script well enough to use the native keyboard. The 
arrangement of characters also makes it much more useable than a regular
 character map utility</p>
<p><strong>Latest changes:</strong> Over the Christmas break I’ve 
applied version 10 upgrades to the following pickers: Bengali, Hebrew, 
Khmer, Lao, Malayalam, Myanmar, Thai and Tifinagh.  In the case of 
Hebrew and Tifinagh, this came down to completely rewriting the pickers.</p>
<p>Key changes in version 10 include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The visible layout of the shape view has been reduced in the 
vertical direction by showing a group of characters only when you mouse 
over the orange keys at the top. This makes it easier and faster to 
locate characters, and also improves use on screens with restricted 
space.  The way similar characters in other groups is handled has been 
reinvented to fit the new approach better, and enable faster creation of
 pickers in the future.</li>
<li>The visible layout of the transcription view has been adapted in a similar way to the shape view.</li>
<li>The button to dump the phonetic buffer has been moved to just below the output area.</li>
<li>The Detail button is now called the Analyse button, and both this 
and the Codepoints commands now bring up the new String Analyser 
utility, which provides much better results than the old pages.</li>
<li>A keyboard view has been added to the Tifinagh picker.   This new view may pop up in other pickers in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were a number of other changes to the code, and not least to 
the instructions for use on the main picker page and each set of notes 
below the pickers themselves.

<p><strong>Latest changes:</strong> This is the first version 9 picker. 
 Changes introduced in version 9 include moving the buttons that allow 
you to display different views to just below the page title. Also, in 
version 8 pickers, there was an icon in the phonic view that allowed you
 to dump to the output the phonetic transcription that builds up while 
selecting characters. This has been replaced with a button just below 
the output field. There were a number of other superficial changes.</p>
<p>A significant addition to the Malayalam picker is the ability to 
convert Malayalam text into a Latin transliteration, based on ISO 15919.
  There was already a way to convert Latin transliterations to Malayalam
 script.</p>
<p>This version also continues to allow you to type in chillu characters
 as either single characters as included in Unicode v5.1, or as a 
sequence of consonant+virama+zwj. Additions to the Malayalam repertoire 
added in v5.2 have not yet been added to the picker.

	<h2 class="post-title">Spell checking and language tags in XMetal: revisited.</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Tue 15 Dec 2009 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=web">web</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=docs">docs</a> &nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>I just received email from Derek Reid in the XMetal team at 
JustSystems to say that they have significantly improved the way the 
XMetal XML editor uses xml:lang attributes in the source code in 
conjunction with its spell-checker.  </p>
<p>Basically, XMetal will switch spell-checking dictionaries based on 
the xml:lang settings in the markup. It also supports xml:lang=”” and 
xml:lang=”zxx” for places you don’t want to spell-check. It even does 
this when using interactive red squiggles to highlight potential 
misspellings.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="blog/?p=83">blog post</a> about this in 2007, when the capability was only partially developed. Derek says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I read this post when you first wrote it, and after getting feedback 
from a large number of our clients I was finally able to convince our 
development and management teams to properly support language 
auto-switching for spell checking in conjunction with xml:lang attribute
 values in our product.</p>
<p>We made a big effort to deal with these limitations during the past 
year and our XMetaL Author Enterprise 6.0 release addresses most or all 
of them.</p>
<p>If you are interested, I have posted instructions on how to configure
 XMetaL Author Enterprise 6.0 to properly support this feature:<br>
<a href="http://forums.xmetal.com/index.php/topic,539.msg1701">http://forums.xmetal.com/index.php/topic,539.msg1701</a></p>

<p>I haven’t had a chance to try it out yet, but it sounds exciting.  Now how about DreamWeaver…</p>

<p><strong>About the tool:</strong> BCP 47 language tags are built from 
subtags in the IANA Subtag Registry. This tool helps you find or look up
 subtags and check for errors in language tags. It also provides 
information to guide your choices.</p>
<p><strong>Latest changes:</strong> I reworked the informational text 
that accompanies macrolanguages, their encompassed languages, and 
extlang subtags.  As part of that, I changed the code to allow for 
highlighting of specific cases. For example, where legacy may dictate 
that the macrolanguage subtag (zh) is more useful for Mandarin Chinese 
than the more specific tags (cmn or zh-cmn).</p>
<p>I simplified the intro to the page, but added a link to the new article <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags">Choosing a Language Tag</a>, which provides useful step-by-step guidelines on creating language tags.</p>
<p>I also changed the user interface somewhat. The input fields are 
easier to work with and take up less vertical space.  Also, you can now 
submit a query by simply hitting return after typing into a field.  I 
had originally required you to click on a submit button so that all 
values in other fields would be retained when the answer is shown – this
 was so that while checking various subtags you could build up a 
language tag in the Check field for later checking.  I just found that 
the annoyance of continually having to resubmit after forgetting to 
click on the submit button wasn’t worth the extra functionality (and I 
was also encouraged to do so by feedback from Bert Bos).</p>

<p>It took me a while to find the time, but I have finally upgraded 
UniView to suport the final 5.2 release of Unicode, plus a few extra 
features.</p>
<p>The order of blocks listed in the top left pulldown menu was changed to ressemble the order in the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts">Unicode Charts page</a>. Several sub-block selections were also added to the list (as in the Unicode page), and are displayed in italics.</p>
<p>When you display details of a character in the right panel, the heading <code>Script group</code>
 has now been used to indicate the sub-block-level headings in the block
 listings of the Unicode Standard. The link to the Unicode block now 
follows the heading <code>Unicode block</code>. These sub-block-level headings are also shown when you display a range as a list (as opposed to a matrix).</p>
<p>When you mouse over characters displayed in a matrix, the codepoint 
and name information for that character now appear just above the 
matrix. This makes it much easier to locate characters you are looking 
for.</p>
<p>Finally, but by no means least, small and large graphics are now 
available for all 1071 Egyptian Hieroglyph characters. This was the last
 block for which graphics were completely unavailable.</p>

			<p>At first glance it looks like a mix of Arabic and Cree, with the artificiality and non-calligraphic nature of Cree combined with the long extenders and curves of Arabic.  If you tried to write with it by hand for a long time, maybe it would become more condensed, like Pitman short-hand. Or if you wrote it with a calligraphic pen — maybe I should try that!</p>

<p>I have added a bunch of additional new features to my lookup tool to 
help with choosing language tags. There is additional information 
available when you look up subtags (such as what to use if the subtag is
 deprecated, and what subtags macrolanguages enclose, etc.), and more 
tests on well-formedness with clearer explanations of the problem.  <a href="https://r12a.github.io/utils/subtags/index.php?lookup=mg+valencia+avst+in&amp;submit=Look+up">Example</a>.</p>
<p>This should make it a lot more useful to people who haven’t read BCP 
47 and want to create language tags.  Hopefully, in a short while, I’ll 
also write and link to an article that describes how to use subtags from
 the ground up in a procedural way, that will complement the tool.</p>
<p>For further assistance, you can now link from a language subtag 
result to the SIL Ethnologue, to make it easier to check whether that 
subtag really does refer to the language you were thinking of.</p>
<p>In addition, script subtag results link to Unicode blocks in UniView.</p>

<p>The IANA Subtag Registry has been recently updated to contain 220 
extlang subtags and the ISO 639-3 language subtags, taking the total 
number of subtags to almost 8,000. </p>
<p>I have produced a new version of my lookup tool to help with language
 tagging. In addition to helping you find subtags and lookup the meaning
 of subtags, it now helps check the well-formedness of a language tag.</p>
<p>The tool provides access to all currently defined subtags, including the new extlang subtags.</p>
<p><strong>Parsing language tags.</strong> In addition to trying to make
 the user interface more friendly, I also added the ability to parse 
hyphenated tags and discover their structure and check for errors.  I’m 
not claiming with this release that the new parser field tests all the 
corner cases, but it should provide reports for most of the typical 
errors.</p>
<p>It reports errors for the following:</p>
<p>– subtags that are not in the registry (by type)<br>
– incorrectly ordered subtags<br>
– duplicate variant tags and multiple tags of other types<br>
– overlong private use subtags</p>
<p>Try <a href="https://r12a.github.io/utils/subtags/index.php?check=de-419-DE-alt&amp;submit=Check">this example</a>. </p>
<p>It doesn’t yet handle extensions, but then there aren’t any valid ones to handle yet anyway.</p>
<p>I hope that’s useful.</p>

<p>Following hot on the heels of the last release come some further 
significant changes to UniView aimed at making it easier to use as 
Unicode grows.</p>
<p>The big change is that UniView now starts up in graphics mode by 
default. This means that pages load more slowly, but (especially with 
the continuing growth of Unicode) also means that you are more likely to
 be able to see the characters you are looking for. It’s easy to switch 
between modes at any point, using the “<span style="color:brown">Use graphics</span>” checkbox.  (And if you preferred font glyphs as a default, you just need to <a href="https://r12a.github.io/uniview/help.html#defaults">change the URI</a> in your bookmarked link slightly, and you can continue to work that way.)</p>
<p>To facilitate this change, I created my own graphics for a number of 
blocks which are not yet covered by decodeunicode, or which are no 
longer fully covered by decodeunicode. The blocks for which I provided 
graphics are <strong>Latin Extended-C, Latin Extended-D, Latin Extended 
Additional, Cyrillic Supplement, Cyrillic Extended-B, Modifier Tone 
Letters, Tibetan, Malayalam, Saurashtra, Ol Chiki, Myanmar, Kayah Li, 
Cham, Rejang, Vai, Supplemental Punctuation</strong>, and <strong>Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows.</strong></p>
<p>There are still many characters for which there are no graphics 
(especially the new characters in Unicode 5.2), but coverage is much 
better than it was. As I find more fonts, I will be able to create 
graphics for the remaining characters.</p>
<p>I also put a grey box around the characters in tables. This is 
particularly useful if there are no graphics or font glyphs for a block 
or range of characters, as it makes it easier to locate the character 
you are looking for.</p>
<p>I also fixed a bug that was preventing Chrome and Safari and IE from 
displaying the first two Latin blocks. I think the bug was actually in 
the Unicode data file.</p>

<p>With the family now in Japan, I had some extra time to spare this 
weekend, so I upgraded UniView to handle all the proposed characters for
 Unicode 5.2.  </p>
<p>While the properties for new and modified characters are still in 
beta they are not officially stable, however the character allocations 
should be stable at this point. UniView therefore alerts you if you are 
looking at a new character. </p>
<p>If the Unicode database information has changed for a given character
 you are also warned, and provided with a link that points to the 
previous information for that character. These warnings will be removed 
from UniView when Unicode 5.2 is released.</p>
<p>Of course, you are unlikely to be able to actually see the new 
characters themselves, unless you are lucky enough to have a very new 
font to hand.  The graphic alternatives are not available yet for these 
characters.  I’m wondering whether it’s possible for me to do something 
about that, but that will take a little longer. In the meantime, you 
might find it more useful to view blocks in list view. (Click on ‘Show 
range as list’).</p>
<p>This release also fixes a few small bugs in the HTML and JavaScript code.</p>

<p>A new version of this very popular tool is now available, in a new 
location. Although it is currently labeled ‘beta’, I recommend that you 
use that instead, and change any links and bookmarks to the new 
location. There are a number of new features. </p>
<p>There is also a vastly improved code base.  If you are one of the 
many people who have contacted me to ask how I coded the conversions, 
please take a look at <a href="https://r12a.github.io/tools/conversion/conversionfunctions.js">the new javascript code</a>.  It is much cleaner and more compact.</p>
<p>New features include:</p>
<p>    *  New mixed input field and position of some fields changed.<br>
    * New field for conversion of 0x… notation hex escapes.<br>
    * Enabled invisible and ambiguous characters to be made visible in the XML output.<br>
    * Added support for all HTML entities in HTML/XML input.<br>
    * All code rewritten to use characters as the internal 
representation, rather than code points. Also, code is much smaller and 
cleaner, partly through use of regular expression matching.<br>
    * Various filters available for conversion, such as allowing ASCII or Latin1 characters to remain unconverted in NCR output.<br>
    * New icon to quickly select all contents of a field.</p>
<p>There is also a new demonstration feature.</p>
<p>If there are no issues raised/remaining in a couple of months, I’ll remove the beta tag.</p>

<p class="floatright"><img src="r12a_blog_files/territories.png" alt="Picture of the page in action."></p>
<p>This is a new tool that helps you to locate a country or territory on
 a map of the world.  Ever wondered where Khazakhstan is?  This will 
show you.</p>
<p>The map is in SVG and expands to fill the window. Territories are coloured red. Very small territories are marked by a red dot.</p>
<p>The map comes from Wikipedia. The list of territories comes from the 
regions listed in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. I can’t guarrantee 
that all the territories in the pulldown list are viewable, but nearly 
all are.</p>
<p>It’s quite a big SVG file, so it takes a little while to draw.  I’ll 
try to speed that up in the future. It seems to draw much faster on 
Chrome or Opera than on Firefox or IE.</p>
<p>For the future I have some other ideas, such as displaying the 
country name natively, and linking to Wikipedia articles, CLDR data, 
etc.  But that’s for later.</p>
<p style="color:brown;">Update: Almost every time I located a country, I
 found myself wondering what the countries alongside are. So now as you 
move your mouse over a country, the name of that country pops up.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>The major changes in this version include a new feature to normalise 
text as NFC or NFD, the ability to accept decimal code point values, and
 an overhaul of top part of the user interface.</p>
<p>Added buttons to the <span class="onscreen">Text area</span> to allow
 conversion of the text to NFC or NFD normalization forms. (You may not 
notice the change until you list the characters.)</p>
<p>The control panel was also substantially rearranged again to hopefully make it easier for newcomers to see what they can do.</p>
<p>The <span class="onscreen">Code point</span> conversion feature was upgraded to handle decimal code point values.</p>
<p>A single character in the codepoints area or text area is now listed in the lower left panel when you click on <img src="r12a_blog_files/apply.gif" alt=" " border="0" align="bottom">, rather than in the right-hand properties panel.  This is to improve consistency and avoid surprises.</p>
<p>Added a link to the CLDR property demo from the right panel to give access to additional properties.</p>
<p>Improved the parsing of codepoints when surrounded by text in the <span class="onscreen">Code point</span> input field, so that it now works with &amp;#x…;  and \u… and \U… escapes.</p>
<p>Jettisoned some unneeded code to reduce download by around 40-50K 
bytes. Implemented the NFC/NFD feature using AJAX, to avoid putting the 
download size back up.</p>
<p>When you delete the contents of the text area or the code point area,
 the associated input field is given focus, so you are ready for input.</p>
<p>A couple more minor bug fixes.</p>

	<h2 class="post-title">Normalization code</h2>
	<p class="entrymeta">Posted on Wed 4 Feb 2009 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=codenotes">codenotes</a>&nbsp; </p>
	</div>
<div class="post-content">
	<p>I was asked to make available the code for my normalization 
functions in JavaScript and PHP.  The links are below. I’m making the 
code available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike</a> licence. </p>
<p><strong>Disclaimers</strong> Note that I make no claim to have 
produced polished, compact or well-optimised code!  The code does what I
 need, and I’m happy with that.  You are welcome to suggest 
improvements, and I’m sure there are many that could be made.</p>
<p>As they say, this code is made available in the hope that it will be 
useful, but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of 
merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
<p>The code is a little more convoluted that it ought to be, to get 
around the fact that JavaScript doesn’t understand supplementary 
characters, and PHP just doesn’t naturally understand Unicode. (How I 
long for PHP6.)</p>
<p><strong>Update: [[</strong>I meant to mention that there is a way of <a href="http://us.php.net/manual/en/class.normalizer.php">doing normalization in PHP</a>
 already.  I made this code available just because I had it.  I created 
it as a learning exercise. It may be useful, however, if you are unable 
to load the ICU and intl packages onto your server.<strong>]]</strong></p>
<p><strong>To use the code</strong>, simply call <code>nfc('your-text-string')</code> or <code>nfd('your-text-string')</code> from your code and capture the result.</p>
<p><strong>For PHP</strong> you’ll need <a href="https://r12a.github.io/code/showsource.php?source=normalization/n11n.php">these routines</a> and <a href="https://r12a.github.io/code/showsource.php?source=normalization/n11ndata.php">this data</a>.</p>
<p><strong>For JavaScript</strong> look at <a href="https://r12a.github.io/code/showsource.php?source=normalization/js/n11n.js">these routines</a> and <a href="https://r12a.github.io/code/showsource.php?source=normalization/js/n11ndata.js">this data</a>.  There is also a <a href="https://r12a.github.io/code/showsource.php?source=normalization/js/n11ndata-lite.js">lite version</a> of the data file that doesn’t include Han characters.  I use this sometimes for bandwidth savings (about 14K less).</p>
<p><strong>Test files</strong> I also created some test files for <a href="https://r12a.github.io/code/showsource.php?source=normalization/tests/n11ntestphp.php">PHP</a> and for <a href="https://r12a.github.io/code/showsource.php?source=normalization/tests/n11ntestjs.php">JavaScript</a>.<br>
Both of these expect to find a copy of <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NormalizationTest.txt">http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NormalizationTest.txt</a> in the local directory.  These files run 71,076 tests.</p>
<p><strong>Cautions</strong> Be careful about the editor you use for the
 data files.  I spent several hours fruitlessly debugging the routines, 
only to find that Notepad++ was displaying certain supplementary 
characters ok, but corrupting them on save.  I switched to Notepad and 
the problem evaporated. And I probably don’t need to add that editing 
the data files in something like DreamWeaver is a bad idea because it 
will probably normalize the data before saving.</p>
<p>Another point: you may see Unicode replacement characters at a couple
 of points in the PHP source.  These represent the first and last 
characters in the high surrogate range.</p>
<p><strong>Experimenting</strong> If you want to play with something that uses this you could try my <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/tlicho/">Tłįchǫ (Dogrib) character picker</a>, or my <a href="https://r12a.github.io/tools/normalizer/">Normalizer</a> tool.  I will slowly fit this to all the pickers and to <a href="https://r12a.github.io/uniview/">UniView</a>.
  I have a local version of UniView waiting in the wings that uses the 
PHP files via AJAX, to reduce download size.  For that you need a file 
that returns the result as plain text across the wire, such as <a href="https://r12a.github.io/code/showsource.php?source=normalization/getn11n.php">this</a>.</p>
<p>Well, I hope that that may be of use to someone, somewhere.  I hope I haven’t forgotten anything.</p>

<p>This tool allows you to normalise short pieces of text to Unicode 
forms NFC or NFD.  You can paste the relevant text into a text area, or 
append it to the uri that calls the page, eg. <a href="https://r12a.github.io/tools/normalizer/index.php?str=T%C3%AAn+mi%E1%BB%81n+kh%C3%B4ng+gian+trong+XML+cung+c%E1%BA%A5p+m%E1%BB%99t+ph%C6%B0%C6%A1ng+ph%C3%A1p+%C4%91%C6%A1n+gi%E1%BA%A3n+%C4%91%E1%BB%83+ti%C3%AAu+chu%E1%BA%A9n">Vietnamese example</a>.</p>
<p>Note that, although I spell normalisation in the British way in this 
post, the uri uses the American spelling, since I suspect most users of 
the tool will expect it to be spelt that way.</p>
<p><strong>Wondering what normalisation is?</strong> In Unicode a letter
 like á can be represented by a (precomposed) single character or by an a
 followed by an acute accent (a decomposed sequence).  Unicode regards 
these two representations as formally equivalent.  If you are comparing 
strings, therefore, you need to know which representations are 
equivalent. Usually you would want to normalise your text prior to 
comparison to a given normalisation form, so that the comparison process
 can be efficient.  Unicode defines four normalization forms, two of 
which, NFD and NFC, are handled by this tool.</p>
<p>Basically NFD reduces all precomposed characters to their decomposed 
equivalents, whereas NFC uses precomposed characters for most common 
situations.</p>
