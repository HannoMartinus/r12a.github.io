            <span style="font-size: 150%"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/apps/encodings/">&gt;&gt; Use the app</a></span></p>
          <p>This app allows you to see how Unicode characters are represented as 
            bytes in various legacy encodings, and vice versa. You can customise the
            encodings you want to experiment with by clicking on <span class="kw">change encodings shown</span>. The default selection excludes most of the single-byte encodings.</p>
          <p>The app provides a way of detecting the likely encoding of a sequence
            of bytes if you have no context, and also allows you to see which 
            encodings support specific characters. The list of encodings is limited 
            to those described for use on the Web by the <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/">Encoding specification</a>.</p>
          <p>The algorithms used are based on those described in the Encoding 
            specification, and thus describe the behaviour you can expect from web 
            browsers. The transforms may not be the same as for other conversion 
            tools. (In some cases the browsers may also produce a different result 
            than shown here, while the implementation of the spec proceeds. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tests/repo/results/encoding-dbl-byte">the tests</a>.)</p>
          <p><strong>Encoding algorithms</strong> convert Unicode characters to 
            sequences of double-digit hex numbers that represent the bytes found in 
            the target character encoding. A character that cannot be handled by an 
            encoder will be represented as a decimal HTML character escape.</p>
          <p><strong>Decoding algorithms</strong> take the byte codes just 
            mentioned and convert them to Unicode characters. The algorithm returns 
            replacement characters where it is unable to map a given byte to the 
            encoding.</p>
          <p>For the decoder input you can provide a string of hex numbers separated by space or by percent signs.</p>
          <p>Green backgrounds appear behind sequences where all characters or 
            bytes were successfully mapped to a character in the given encoding. 
            Beware, however, that the character mapped to may not be the one you 
            expect – especially in the single byte encodings.</p>
          <p>To identify characters and look up information about them you will find <a href="https://r12a.github.io/uniview/">UniView</a> extremely useful. You can paste Unicode characters into the UniView <code class="kw" translate="no">Edit Buffer</code> and click on the down-arrow icon below to find out what they are. 
            (Click on the name that appears for more detailed information.)  It is 
            particularly useful for identifying escaped characters. Copy the 
            escape(s) to the <code class="kw" translate="no">Find</code> input area on UniView and click on <code class="kw" translate="no">Dec</code> just below.</p>

            <span style="font-size: 150%"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/mongolian/">&gt;&gt; Use the picker</a></span></p>
          <p>An update to version 17 of the <a style="font-size: 120%;" href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/mongolian/">Mongolian character picker</a> is now available.</p>
          <p>When you hover over or select a character in the selection area, the 
            box to the left of that area displays the alternate glyph forms that are
            appropriate for that character. By default, this only happens when you 
            click on a character, but you can make it happen on hover by clicking on
            the <span class="kw">V</span> in the gray selection bar to the right.</p>
          <p>The list includes the default positional forms as well as the forms 
            produced by following the character with a Free Variation Selector 
            (FVS). The latter forms have been updated, based on work which has been 
            taking place in 2015 to standardise the forms produced by using FVS. At 
            the moment, not all fonts will produce the expected shapes for all 
            possible combinations. (For more information, see <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/mongolian/variants">Notes on Mongolian variant forms</a>.)</p>
          <p>An additional new feature is that when the variant list is displayed,
            you can add an appropriate FVS character to the output area by simply 
            clicking in the list on the shape that you want to see in the output.</p>
          <p>This provides an easy way to check what shapes should be produced and
            what shapes are produced by a given font. (You can specify which font 
            the app should use for display of the output.) </p>
          <p>Some small improvements were also made to the user interface.  The 
            picker works best in Firefox and Edge desktop browsers, since they now 
            have pretty good support for vertical text. It works least well in 
            Safari (which includes the iPad browsers).</p>
          <p>For more information about the picker, see the notes at the bottom of the picker page.</p>
          <p><strong>About pickers:</strong> <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/">Pickers</a> allow you to quickly create phrases in a script by clicking on Unicode 
            characters arranged in a way that aids their identification. Pickers are
            likely to be most useful if you don’t know a script well enough to use 
            the native keyboard. The arrangement of characters also makes it much 
            more usable than a regular character map utility. See the <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/">list of available pickers</a>.</p>

          <p>This update allows you to link to information about Han characters 
            and Hangul syllables, and fixes some bugs related to the display of Han 
            character blocks.</p>
          <p>Information about Han characters displayed in the lower right area will have a link <span class="kw">View data in Unihan database</span>. As expected, this opens a new window at the page of the Unihan database corresponding to this character.</p>
          <p>Han and hangul characters also have a link <span class="kw">View in PDF code charts (pageXX)</span>.
            On Firefox and Chrome, this will open the PDF file for that block at 
            the page that lists this character. (For Safari and Edge you will need 
            to scroll to the page indicated.) The PDF is useful if there is no 
            picture or font glyph for that character, but also allows you to see the
            variant forms of the character.</p>
          <p>For some Han blocks, the number of characters per page in the PDF file varies slightly. In this case you will see the text <span class="kw">approx</span>; you may have to look at a page adjacent to the one you are taken to for these characters.</p>
          <p>Note that some of the PDF files are quite large. If the file size exceeds 3Mb, a warning is included.</p>

          <p>Unicode 8.0.0 is released today. This new version of UniView adds the
            new characters encoded in Unicode 8.0.0 (including 6 new scripts). The

          <p>The github site now holds images for all 28,000+ Unicode codepoints 
            other than Han ideographs and Hangul syllables (in two sizes).</p>
          <p>I also fixed the Show Age filter, and brought it up to date.</p>

            <img src="r12a_blog_files/dot-above.png" alt="Light tone mark in annotation." class="withshadow"></p>
          <p>A key issue for handling of bopomofo (zhùyīn fúhào) is the placement 
            of tone marks. When bopomofo text runs vertically (either on its own, or
            as a phonetic annotation), some smarts are needed to display tone marks
            in the right place. This may also be required (though with different 
            rules) for bopomofo when used horizontally for <em>phonetic annotations</em> (ie. above a base character), but not in all such cases. However, when 
            bopomofo is written horizontally in any other situation (ie. when not 
            written above a base character), the tone mark typically follows the 
            last bopomofo letter in the syllable, with no special handling.</p>
          <p>From time to time questions are raised on W3C mailing lists about how
            to implement phonetic annotations in bopomofo. Participants in these 
            discussions need a good understanding of the various complexities of 
            bopomofo rendering.</p>
          <p>To help with that, I just uploaded a new Web page <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/bopomofo/ontheweb" style="font-size: 120%;">Bopomofo on the Web</a>.
            The aim is to provide background information, and carry useful ideas 
            from one discussion to the next. I also add some personal thoughts on 
            implementation alternatives, given current data.</p>
          <p>I intend to update the page from time to time, as new information becomes available.</p>

          <p>The CSS WG needs advice on initial letter styling in non-Latin 
            scripts, ie. enlarged letters or syllables at the start of a paragraph 
            like those shown in the picture. Most of the current content of the 
            recently published Working Draft, <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-inline/">CSS Inline Layout Module Level 3</a> is about <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-inline/#initial-letter-styling">styling of initial letters</a>, but the editors need to ensure that they have covered the needs of users of non-Latin scripts.</p>
          <p>The spec currently describes drop, sunken and raised initial characters, and allows you to manipulate them using the <span class="kw" translate="no">initial-letter</span> and the <span translate="no" class="kw">initial-letter-align</span> properties. You can apply those properties to text selected by <span translate="no" class="kw">::first-letter</span>, or to the first child of a block (such as a <span translate="no" class="kw">span</span>).</p>
          <p>The editors are looking for </p>
          <blockquote style="font-style:italic">
            <p>any examples of drop initials in non-western scripts, especially Arabic and Indic scripts.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>I have scanned <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ishida/sets/72157650248400402/">some examples from newspapers</a> (so, not high quality print).</p>
          <p>In the section about initial-letter-align the spec says:</p>
          <blockquote style="font-style:italic">
            <p>Input from those knowledgeable 
              about non-Western typographic traditions would be very helpful in 
              describing the appropriate alignments. More values may be required for 
              this property.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">The Combining Character Conundrum</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Tue 6 Jan 2015 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=layout">layout</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=scripts">scripts</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=unicode">unicode</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I’m struggling to show combining characters on a page in a consistent way across browsers.</p>
          <p>For example, while laying out my <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/">pickers</a>,
            I want users to be able to click on a representation of a character to 
            add it to the output field. In the past I resorted to pictures of the 
            characters, but now that webfonts are available, I want to replace those
            with font glyphs. (That makes for much smaller and more flexible 
            pages.)</p>
          <p>Take the Bengali picker that I’m currently working on.  I’d like to end up with something like this:</p>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/comchacon0.png"><img src="r12a_blog_files/comchacon0.png" alt="comchacon0" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1442" width="244" height="118"></a></p>
          <p>I put a no-break space before each combining character, to give it 
            some width, and because that’s what the Unicode Standard recommends (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch02.pdf">p60, Exhibiting Nonspacing Marks in Isolation</a>). The result is close to what I was looking for in Chrome and Safari except that you can see a gap for the nbsp to the left.</p>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/comchacon1.png"><img src="r12a_blog_files/comchacon1.png" alt="comchacon1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1431" width="297" height="118"></a></p>
          <p>But in IE and Firefox I get this:</p>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/comchacon2.png"><img src="r12a_blog_files/comchacon2.png" alt="comchacon2" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1432" width="296" height="114"></a></p>
          <p>This is especially problematic since it messes up the overall layout, but in some cases it also causes text to overlap.</p>
          <p>I tried using a dotted circle Unicode character, instead of the 
            no-break space. On Firefox this looked ok, but on Chrome it resulted in 
            two dotted circles per combining character.</p>
          <p>I considered using a consonant as the base character. It would work 
            ok, but it would possibly widen the overall space needed (not ideal) and
            would make it harder to spot a combining character by shape. I tried 
            putting a span around the base character to grey it out, but the various
            browsers reacted differently to the span. Vowel signs that appear on 
            both sides of the base character no longer worked – the vowel sign 
            appeared after. In other cases, the grey of the base character was 
            inherited by the whole grapheme, regardless of the fact that the 
            combining character was outside the span.  (Here are some examples <span style="color:#eee;">ক</span>ে and <span style="color:#eee;">ক</span>ো.)</p>
          <p>In the end, I settled for no preceding base character at all. The 
            combining character was the first thing in the table cell or span that 
            surrounded it.  This gave the desired result for the font I had been 
            using, albeit that I needed to tweak the occasional character with 
            padding to move it slightly to the right.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, this was not to be a complete solution either.  
            Whereas most of the fonts I planned to use produce the dotted circle in 
            these conditions, one of my favourites (SolaimanLipi) doesn’t produce 
            it.  This leads to significant problems, since many combining characters
            appear far to the left, and in some cases it is not possible to click 
            on them, in others you have to locate a blank space somewhere to the 
            right and click on that. Not at all satisfactory.</p>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/comchacon3.png"><img src="r12a_blog_files/comchacon3.png" alt="comchacon3" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1452" width="235" height="116"></a></p>
          <p>I couldn’t find a better way to solve the problem, however, and since
            there were several Bengali fonts to choose from that did produce dotted
            circles, I settled for that as the best of a bad lot.</p>
          <p>However, then i turned my attention to other pickers and tried the 
            same solution.  I found that only one of the many Thai fonts I tried for
            the Thai picker produced the dotted circles. So the approach here would
            have to be different.  For Khmer, the main Windows font (Daunpenh) 
            produced dotted circles only for some of the combining characters in 
            Internet Explorer.  And on Chrome, a sequence of two combining 
            characters, one after the other, produced two dotted circles…</p>
          <p>I suspect that I’ll need to choose an approach for each picker based 
            on what fonts are available, and perhaps provide an option to insert or 
            remove base characters before combining characters when someone wants to
            use a different font.</p>
          <p>It would be nice to standardise behaviour here, and to do so in a way
            that involves the no-break space, as described in the Unicode Standard,
            or some other base character such as – why not? – the dotted circle 
            itself.  I assume that the fix for this would have to be handled by the 
            browser, since there are already many font cats out of the bag.</p>
          <p>Does anyone have an alternate solution?  I thought I heard someone at
            the last Unicode conference mention some way of controlling the 
            behaviour of dotted circles via some script or font setting…?</p>

              <p>Richard, your post tickled my memory about a draft sitting in my list of blog posts to complete, so I sat down and completed it. My blog describes how we resolved the combining issue for a Lao keyboard; the principle should be applicable to other systems. It’s a bit wordy though…</p>

          <p>I have uploaded a new version of the <a style="font-size: 120%;" href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/khmer/">Khmer character picker</a>.</p>

          <p>Other than a small rearrangement of the default selection table to accomodate fonts rather than images, and the significant <a href="blog/?p=1401">standard features that version 16 brings</a>, there are no additional changes in this version.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">More picker changes: Version 16</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Sun 4 Jan 2015 tagged as  <a href="blog/?tag=apps">apps</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=pickers">pickers </a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>A couple of posts ago I mentioned that I had updated the Thai picker
            to version 16. I have now updated a few more. For ease of reference, I 
            will list here the main changes between version 16 <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/">pickers</a> and previous versions back to version 12.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Fonts rather than graphics.</strong> The main selection table
                in version 12 used images to represent characters. These have now gone,
                in favour of fonts. Most pickers include a web font download to ensure 
                that you will see the characters.  This reduces the size and download 
                time significantly when you open a picker. Other source code changes 
                have reduced the size of the files even further, so that the main file 
                is typically only a small fraction of the size it was in version 14.</p>
              <p>It is also now possible, in version 16, to change the font of the main selection table and the font size.</p>
              <p></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>UI.</strong> The whole look and feel of the user interface 
                has changed from version 14 onwards, and includes useful links and 
                explanations off the top of the normal work space.</p>
              <p>In particular, the vertical menu, introduced in version 14, has been 
                adjusted so that input features can be turned on and off independently, 
                and new panels appear alongside the others, rather than toggling the 
                view from one mode to another. So, for example, you can have hints and 
                shape-based selectors turned on at the same time. When something is 
                switched on, its label in the menu turns orange, and the full text of 
                the option is followed by a check mark.</p>
              <p></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Transcription panels.</strong> Some pickers had one or more 
                transcription views in versions below 16. These enable you to construct 
                some non-Latin text when working from a Latin transcription. In version 
                16 these alternate views are converted to panels that can be displayed 
                at the same time as other information. They can be shown or hidden from 
                the vertical menu. When there is ambiguity as to which characters to 
                use, a pop up displays alternatives. Click on one to insert it into the 
                output. There is also a panel containing non-ASCII Latin characters, 
                which can be used when typing Latin transcriptions directly into the 
                main output area. This panel is now hidden by default, but can be easily
                shown from the vertical menu.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Automated transcription.</strong> Version 16 pickers carry 
                forward, and in some cases add, automated transcription converters. In 
                some cases these are intended to generate only an approximation to the 
                needed transcription, in order to speed up the transcription process. In
                other cases, they are complete. (See the notes for the picker to tell 
                which is which.) Where there is ambiguity about how to transcribe a 
                sequence of characters, the interface offers you a choice from 
                alternatives. Just click on the character you want and it will replace 
                all the options proposed. In some cases, particularly South-East Asian 
                scripts, the text you want to transcribe has to be split into syllables 
                first, using spaces and or hyphens. Where this is necessary, a <span class="kw">condense</span> button it provided, to quickly strip out the separators after the transcription is done.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Layout</strong> The default layout of the main selection 
                table has usually been improved, to make it easier to locate characters.
                Rarely used, deprecated, etc, characters appear below the main table, 
                rather than to the right.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Hints</strong> Very early versions of the pickers used to 
                automatically highlight similar and easily confusable characters when 
                you hovered over a character in the main selection table. This feature 
                is being reintroduced as standard for version 16 pickers. It can be 
                turned on or off from the vertical menu.  This is very helpful for 
                people who don’t know the script well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Shape-based selection.</strong> In previous versions the 
                shape-based view replaced the default view. In version 16 the shape 
                selectors appear below the main selection table and highlight the 
                characters in that table. This arrangement has several advantages.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Applying actions to ranges of text.</strong> When clicking on the <span class="kw">Codepoints</span> and <span class="kw">Escapes</span> buttons, it is possible to apply the action to a highighted range of 
                characters, rather than all the characters in the output area. It is 
                also possible to transcribe only highlighted text, when using one of the
                automated transcription features.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Phoneme bank.</strong> When composing text from a Latin 
                transcription in previous versions you had to make choices about 
                phonetics. Those choices were stored on the UI to speed up generation of
                phonetic transcriptions in addition to the native text, but this 
                feature somewhat complicated the development and use of the 
                transcription feature. It has been dropped in version 16. Hopefully, the
                transcription panels and automated transcription features will be 
                useful enough in future.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Font grid.</strong> The font grid view was removed in version 16. It is of little value when the characters are already displayed using fonts.</p>

          <p>This update to the <a style="font-size: 120%;" href="https://r12a.github.io/utils/subtags/" target="subtags">Language Subtag Lookup</a> tool brings back the <span class="kw">Check</span> function that had been out of action since last January.  The code had 
            to be pretty much completely rewritten to migrate it from the original 
            PHP. In the process, I added support for extension and private use tags,
            and added several more checks.  I also made various changes to the way 
            the results are displayed.</p>
          <p>Give it a try with this rather complicated, but valid language tag: <a href="https://r12a.github.io/utils/subtags/?check=zh-cmn-latn-CN-pinyin-fonipa-u-co-phonebk-x-mytag-yourtag" target="subtags">zh-cmn-latn-CN-pinyin-fonipa-u-co-phonebk-x-mytag-yourtag</a></p>
          <p>Or try this rather badly conceived language tag, to see some error messages: <a href="https://r12a.github.io/utils/subtags/?check=mena-fr-latn-fonipa-biske-x-mylongtag-x-shorter" target="subtags">mena-fr-latn-fonipa-biske-x-mylongtag-x-shorter</a></p>
          <p>The IANA database information is up-to-date. The tool currently 
            supports the IANA Subtag registry of 2014-12-17. It reports subtags for 
            8,081 languages, 228 extlangs, 174 scripts, 301 regions, 68 variants, 
            and 26 grandfathered subtags.</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Thai character picker v16</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Sun 21 Dec 2014 tagged as <a href="blog/?tag=apps">apps</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=pickers">pickers</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=thai">thai</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="floatright" style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/thai/"><img class="withshadow" src="r12a_blog_files/thai-picker-15-300x295.png" alt="  " width="300" height="295"></a></p>
          <p>I have uploaded another new version of the <a style="font-size: 120%;" href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/thai/">Thai character picker</a>.</p>
          <p>Sorry this follows so quickly on the heels of <a href="blog/?p=1358">version 15</a>,
            but as soon as I uploaded v15 several ideas on how to improve it popped
            into my head. This is the result. I will hopefully bring all the 
            pickers, one by one, up to the new version 16 format. If you prefer, you
            can still access <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/thai12/">version 12</a>.</p>
          <p>The main changes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>UI.</strong> Adjustment of the vertical menu, so that input 
              features can be turned on and off independently, and new panels appear 
              with the others, rather than toggling from one to another. So, for 
              example, you can have hints and shape-based selectors turned on at the 
              same time. When something is switched on, its label in the menu turns 
              orange, and the full text of the option is followed by a check mark.</li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Transcription panels.</strong> Panels have been added to 
                enable you to construct some Thai text when working from a Latin 
                transcription. This brings the transcription inputs of version 12 into 
                version 16, but in a more compact and simpler way, and way that gives 
                you continued access to the standard table for special characters.</p>
              <p>There are currently options to transcribe from ISO 11940-2 (although 
                there are some gaps in that), or from the transcription used by Benjawan
                Poomsan Becker in her book, <cite>Thai for Beginners</cite>. These are 
                both transcriptions based on phonetic renderings of the Thai, so there 
                is often ambiguity about how to transcribe a particular Latin letter 
                into Thai. When such an ambiguity occurs, the interface offers you a 
                choice via a small pop-up. Just click on the character you want and it 
                will be inserted into the main output area.</p>
              <p>The transcription panels are useful because you can add a whole vowel
                at a time, rather than picking the individual vowel signs that compose 
                it. An issue arises, however, when the vowel signs that make up a given 
                vowel contain one that appears to the left of the syllable initial 
                consonant(s). This is easily solved by highlighting the syllable in 
                question and clicking on the <span class="kw" translate="no">reorder</span> button. The vowel sign in question will then appear as the first item in the highlighted text.</p>
              <p>There is also a panel containing non-ASCII Latin characters, which 
                can be used when typing Latin transcriptions directly into the main 
                output area. (This was available in v15 too, but has been made into a 
                panel like the others, which can be hidden when not needed.)</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tones for automatic IPA transcriptions.</strong> The 
              automatic transcription to IPA now adds tone marks. These are usually 
              correct, but, as with other aspects of the transcription, it doesn’t 
              take into account the odd idiosyncrasy in Thai spelling, so you should 
              always check that the output is correct. (Note that there is still an 
              issue for some of the ambiguous transcription cases, mostly involving 
              RA.)</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Thu 18 Dec 2014 tagged as  <a href="blog/?tag=apps">apps</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=pickers">pickers</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=thai">thai</a> &nbsp; </p>

          <p>I have uploaded a new version of the <a style="font-size: 120%;" href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/thai/">Thai character picker</a>.</p>
          <p>The new version uses characters instead of images for the selection 
            table, making it faster to load and more flexible, and dispenses with 
            the transcription view. If you prefer, you can still access <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/thai12/">the previous version</a>.</p>
          <p>Other changes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Significant rearrangement of the default selection  table. The new 
              arrangement makes it easy to choose the right characters if you have a 
              Latin transcription to hand, which allows the removal of the previous 
              transcription view, at the same time as speeding up that type of 
              picking.</li>
            <li>Addition of latin prompts to help locate letters (standard with v15).</li>
            <li>Automatic transcription from Thai into ISO 11940-1, ISO 11940-2 and 
              IPA. Note that for the last two there are some corner cases where the 
              results are not quite correct, due to the ambiguity of the script, and 
              note also that you need to show syllable boundaries with spaces before 
              transcribing. (There’s a way to remove those spaces quickly afterwards.)
              See below for more information.</li>
            <li>Hints! When switched on and you mouse over a character, other 
              similar characters or characters incorporating the shape you moused 
              over, are highlighted. Particularly useful for people who don’t know the
              script well, and may miss small differences, but also useful sometimes 
              for finding a character if you first see something similar.</li>
            <li>It also comes with the new v15 features that are standard, such as 
              shape-based picking without losing context, range-selectable codepoint 
              information, a rehabilitated escapes button, the ability to change the 
              font of the table and the line-height of the output, and the ability to 
              turn off autofocus on mobile devices to stop the keyboard jumping up all
              the time, etc.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>More about the transcriptions:</strong> There are three 
            buttons that allow you to convert from Thai text to Latin 
            transcriptions. If you highlight part of the text, only that part will 
            be transcribed.</p>
          <p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">toISO-1</code> button produces an
            ISO 11940-1 transliteration, that latinises the Thai characters  
            without changing their order. The result doesn’t normally tell you how 
            to pronounce the Thai text, but it can be converted back to Thai as each
            Thai character is represented by a unique sequence in Latin. This 
            transcription should produce fully conformant output. There is no need 
            to identify syllables boundaries first.</p>
          <p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">toISO-2</code> and <code class="kw" translate="no">toIPA</code> buttons produce an output that is intended to <strong>approximately</strong> reflect actual pronunciation. It will work fine most of the time, but 
            there are occasional ambiguities and idiosynchrasies in Thai which will 
            cause the converter to render certain, less common syllables 
            incorrectly. It also doesn’t automatically add accent marks to the 
            phonetic version (though that may be added later). So the output of 
            these buttons should be treated as something that gets you 90% of the 
            way. <strong>NOTE: Before using these two buttons you need to add spaces or hyphens between each syllable of the Thai text.</strong> Syllable boundaries are important for correct interpretation of the text, and they are not detected automatically.</p>
          <p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">condense</code> button removes the spaces from the highlighted range (or the whole output area, if nothing is highlighted).</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> For the <code class="kw" translate="no">toISO-2</code> transcription I use a macron over long vowels. This is non-standard.</p>

          <p>I have uploaded a new version of the <a style="font-size: 120%;" href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/tibetan/">Tibetan character picker</a>.</p>
          <p>The new version dispenses with the images for the selection table. If
            you don’t have a suitable font to display the new version of the 
            picker, you can still access <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/tibetan14/">the previous version</a>, which uses images.</p>
          <p>Other changes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Significant rearrangement of the default table, with many less 
              common symbols moved into a location that you need to click on to 
              reveal. This declutters the selection table.</li>
            <li>Addition of latin prompts to help locate letters (standard with v15).</li>
            <li>Hints (When switched on and you mouse over a character, other

              for finding a character if you first see something similar.) </li>
            <li>A new <span class="kw">Wylie</span> button that converts Tibetan 
              text into an extended Wylie Latin transcription. There are still some 
              uncommon characters that don’t work, but it should cover most normal 
              needs. I used diacritics over lowercase letters rather than uppercase 
              letters, except for the fixed form characters. I also didn’t provide 
              conversions for many of the symbols – they will appear without change in
              the transcription. See the notes on the page for more information.</li>
            <li>The <span class="kw">Codepoints</span> button, which produces a list
              of characters in the output box, now has a new feature. If you have 
              highlighted some text in the output box, you will only see a list of the
              highlighted characters. If there are no highlights, the contents of the
              whole output box are listed.</li>
            <li>Don’t forget, if you are using the picker on an iPad or mobile device, to set <span class="kw">Autofocus</span> to <span class="kw">Off</span> before tapping on characters.  This stops the device keypad popping up 
              every time you select a character. (This is also standard for v15.)</li>

          <h2 class="post-title">Mongolian variant forms</h2>
          <p class="entrymeta">Posted on Sat 6 Dec 2014 tagged as  <a href="blog/?tag=scripts">scripts</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=docs">docs</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=unicode">unicode</a>, <a href="blog/?tag=mongolian">mongolian</a> &nbsp; </p>
        </div>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p class="floatright" style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/block/mongolian-variants"><img class="withshadow" src="r12a_blog_files/mongolian-variants-191x300.png" alt="  " width="191" height="300"></a></p>
          <p>There is some confusion about which shapes should be produced by 
            fonts for Mongolian characters. Most letters have at least one isolated,
            initial, medial and final shape, but other shapes are produced by 
            contextual factors, such as vowel harmony. </p>
          <p>Unicode <strong></strong>has a <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/StandardizedVariants.html">list of standardised variant shapes</a>,
            dating from 27 November 2013, but that list is not complete and 
            contains what are currently viewed by some as errors. It also doesn’t 
            specify the expected default shapes for initial, medial and final 
            positions.</p>
          <p>The original list of standardised variants was based on <a href="http://www.babelstone.co.uk/Mongolian/MGWBM.html">蒙古文编码</a> by Professor Quejingzhabu in 2000.</p>
          <p>A <a href="http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14031-mong-chart-upd.pdf">new proposal</a> was published on 20 January 2014, which attempts to resolve the current
            issues, although I think that it introduces one or two issues of its 
            own.</p>
          <p>The other factor in this is what the actual fonts do. Sometimes they 
            follow the Unicode standardised variants list, other times they diverge 
            from it. Occasionally a majority of implementations appear to diverge in
            the same way, suggesting that the standardised list should be adapted 
            to reality.</p>
          <p>To help unravel this, I put together a page called <a style="font-size: 120%;" href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/mongolian/variants">Notes on Mongolian variant forms</a> that visually shows the changes between the various proposals, and compares the results produced by various fonts.</p>
          <p>This is still an early draft. The information only covers the basic 
            Mongolian range – Todo, Sibe, etc still to come.  Also, I would like to 
            add information about other fonts, if I can obtain them.</p>
          <p style="color:brown;">Update: 16 Apr 2015, The Todo, Sibe, Manchu, 
            Sanskrit and Tibetan characters are now all done, and font information 
            added for them. (And the document was moved to <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/mongolian/variants">github</a>.)</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Picker changes</h2>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>If you use my <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/">Unicode character pickers</a>,
            you may have noticed some changes recently. I’ve moved several pickers 
            on to version 14.  Most of the noticeable changes are in the location 
            and styling of elements on the UI – the features remain pretty much 
            unchanged.</p>
          <p>Pages have acquired a header at the top (which is typically hidden), 
            that provides links to related pages, and integrates the style into that
            of the rest of the site. What you don’t see is a large effort to tidy 
            the code base and style sheets.</p>
          <p>So far, I have changed the following: Arabic block, Armenian, 
            Balinese, Bengali, Khmer, IPA, Lao, Mongolian, Myanmar, and Tibetan.</p>
          <p>I will convert more as and when I get time.</p>
          <p>However, in parallel, I have already made a start on version 15, 
            which is a significant rewrite.  Gone are the graphics, to be replaced 
            by characters and webfonts. This makes a huge improvement to the loading
            time of the page. I’m also hoping to introduce more automated 
            transcription methods, and simpler shape matching approaches.</p>
          <p>Some of the pickers I already upgraded to version 14 have mechanisms 
            for transcription and shape-based identification that took a huge effort
            to create, and will take a substantial effort to upgrade to version 15.
            So they may stay as they are for a while. However, easier to handle and
            new pickers will move to the new format.</p>
          <p>Actually, I already made a start with <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/gurmukhi/">Gurmukhi v15</a>, which yanks that picker out of the stone-age and into the future.  There’s also a new <a href="https://r12a.github.io/pickers/uighur/">picker for the Uighur language</a> that uses v15 technology. I’ll write separate blogs about those.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="font-size:80%;">[By the way, if you are viewing the pickers on
            a mobile device such as an iPad, don’t forget to turn Autofocus off 
            (click on ‘more controls’ to find the switch).  This will stop the 
            onscreen keyboard popping up, annoyingly, each time you try to tap on a 
            character.]</p>

          <h2 class="post-title">Notes on Tibetan script</h2>

            See the Tibetan Script Notes</a></p>
          <p>Last March I pulled together some notes about <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/tibetan/">the Tibetan script overall</a>, and <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/block/tibetan">detailed notes about Unicode characters used in Tibetan</a>.</p>
          <p>I am writing these pages as I explore the Tibetan script as used for 
            the Tibetan language. They may be updated from time to time and should 
            not be considered authoritative. Basically I am mostly simplifying, 
            combining, streamlining and arranging the text from the sources listed 
            at the bottom of the page.</p>
          <p>The first half of <a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/tibetan/">the script notes page</a> describes how Unicode characters are used to write Tibetan. The second 
            half looks at text layout in Tibetan (eg. line-breaking, justification, 
            emphasis, punctuation, etc.)</p>
          <p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/block/tibetan">The character notes page</a> lists all the characters in the Unicode Tibetan block, and provides 
            specific usage notes for many of them per their use for writing the 
            Tibetan language.</p>
          <p class="floatright" style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/block/tibetan"><img src="r12a_blog_files/tibetan-char-notes-300x240.png" alt="tibetan-char-notes" class="withshadow" width="300" height="240"><br>
            See the Tibetan Character Notes</a></p>
          <p>Tibetan is an abugida, ie. consonants carry an inherent vowel sound 
            that is overridden using vowel signs. Text runs from left to right.</p>
          <p>There are various different Tibetan scripts, of two basic types: 
            དབུ་ཙན་ dbu-can, pronounced /uchen/ (with a head), and དབུ་མེད་ dbu-med,
            pronounced /ume/ (headless). This page concentrates on the former. 
            Pronunciations are based on the central, Lhasa dialect.</p>
          <p>The pronunciation of Tibetan words is typically much simpler than the
            orthography, which involves patterns of consonants. These reduce 
            ambiguity and can affect pronunciation and tone. In the notes I try to 
            explain how that works, in an approachable way (though it’s still a 
            little complicated, at first).</p>
          <p>Traditional Tibetan text was written on pechas (དཔེ་ཆ་ dpe-cha), 
            loose-leaf sheets. Some of the characters used and formatting approaches
            are different in books and pechas. </p>

          <p>The W3C needs to make sure that the typographic needs of scripts and 
            languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, 
            CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as 
            expected for people around the world.</p>
          <p>To that end we have experts in various parts of the world documenting
            typographic requirements and gaps between what is needed and what is 
            currently supported in browsers and ebook readers. </p>
          <p>The flagship document is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a>.
            The information in this document has been widely used, and the process 
            used for creating it was extremely effective. It was developed in Japan,
            by a task force using mailing lists and holding meetings in japanese, 
            then converted to english for review. It was published in both 
            languages.</p>
          <p>We now have groups working on <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/docs/indic-layout/">Indic Layout Requirements</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/klreq/">Requirements for Hangul Text Layout and Typography</a>,
            and this month I was in Beijing to discuss ongoing work on Chinese 
            layout requirements (URL coming soon), and we heard from experts in 
            Mongolian, Tibetan, and Uyghur who are keen to also participate in the 
            Chinese task force and produce similar documents for their part of the 
            world.</p>
          <p>The Internationalization (i18n) Working Group at the W3C has also 
            been working on other aspects of the mutlilingual user experience. For 
            example, improvements for bidirectional text support (Arabic, Hebrew, 
            Thaana, etc) for HTML and CSS, and supporting the work on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/predefined-counter-styles/">counter styles</a> at CSS.</p>
          <p>To support local relevance of Web pages and eBook formats we need 
            local experts to participate in gathering information in these task 
            forces, to review the task force outputs, and to lobby or support via 
            coding the implementation of features in browsers and ereaders.  If you 
            are one of these people, or know some, please get in touch!</p>
          <p>We particularly need more information about how to handle typographic features of the Arabic script.</p>
          <p>In the hope that it will help, I have put together <strong style="font-size:150%; font-weight: normal;"><a href="https://www.w3.org/International/wiki/Improving_typography_on_the_Web_and_in_eBooks">some
            information on current areas of activity at the W3C, with pointers to 
            useful existing requirements, specifications and tests</a>.</strong> It is not exhaustive, and I expect it to be added to and improved over time.</p>
          <p>Look through the list and check whether your needs are being 
            adequately covered. If not, write to www-international@w3.org (you need 
            to <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/">subscribe</a> first) and make the case. If the spec does cover your needs, but the 
            browsers don’t support your needs, raise bugs against the browsers.</p>

          <p>It’s disappointing to see that non-standard implementations of UTF-8 are being used by the BBC on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcburmese?fref=ts">BBC Burmese Facebook page</a>.</p>
          <p>Take, for example, the following text.</p>
          <p>On the actual <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/burmese/">BBC site</a> it looks like this <em>(click on the burmese text to see a list of the characters used)</em>:</p>
          <p style="font-size: 150%; margin: 20px 9.5%; text-align:left;"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/uniview/?codepoints=1021_102D_1014_1039_1012_102D_101A_0020_1019_102D_1014_103A_1038_1019_1004_101A_103A_0020_1042_1026_1038_0020_1021_1019_103E_102F_0020_1006_1031_1038_1005_1005_103A_1001_103B_1000_103A_0020_1000_103D_1032_101C_103D_1032_1014_1031" title="Click to see a list of characters in this text." target="_blank">အိန္ဒိယ မိန်းမငယ် ၂ဦး အမှု ဆေးစစ်ချက် ကွဲလွဲနေ</a></p>
          <p>As far as I can tell, this is conformant use of Unicode codepoints.</p>
          <p>Look at the same title on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcburmese?fref=ts">BBC’s Facebook page</a>, however, and you see:</p>
          <p style="font-size: 150%; margin: 20px 9.5%; text-align:left;"><a href="https://r12a.github.io/uniview/?codepoints=1021_102D_108F_1075_102D_101A_0020_1019_102D_1014_1039_1038_1019_1004_101A_1039_0020_1042_1026_1038_0020_1021_1019_1088_0020_1031_1006_1038_1005_1005_1039_1001_103A_1000_1039_0020_1000_103C_1032_101C_103C_1032_1031_1014" title="Click to see a list of characters in this text." target="_blank">အိႏၵိယ မိန္းမငယ္ ၂ဦး အမႈ ေဆးစစ္ခ်က္ ကြဲလြဲေန</a></p>
          <p>Depending upon where you are reading this (as long as you have some 
            Burmese font and rendering support), one of the two lines of Burmese 
            text above will contain lots of garbage. For me, it’s the second 
            (non-standard).</p>
          <p>This non-standard approach uses visual encoding for combining 
            characters that appear before or on both sides of the base, uses Shan or
            Rumai Palaung codepoints for subjoining consonants, uses the wrong 
            codepoints for medial consonants, and uses the virama instead of the 
            asat at the end of a word.</p>
          <p>I assume that this is because of prevalent use of the non-standard 
            approach on mobile devices (and that the BBC is just following that 
            trend), caused by hacks that arose when people were impatient to get on 
            the Web but script support was lagging in applications.</p>
          <p>However, continuing this divergence does nobody any long-term good.</p>
